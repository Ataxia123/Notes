ChessGPT "interactable" visual Chess Board w/ Icons

I'm currently working on a Chess companion/coach that can evaluate board positions using visual examples. This has taken a lot longer than expected as ChatGPT really struggles with visualisation, the board orientation and other extremely logical, pedantic issues related to the formatting. There are [unicode](https://i.imgur.com/yl1pcFX.png) chess pieces but they are hard to distinguish, my aim is to use [Emojis](https://i.imgur.com/XRLIZIQ.png) but using them in the initial prompt breaks the whole thing. There is an option to use markdown image embeds, but this already hammers the tokens as it is. For now i'm using algebraic letter notation.

   
I was only able to test a couple of moves sadly I'm waiting on my GPT4 allowance before I can go further!

You provide an original FEN position. ChatGPT outputs a Markdown table for a visual Chess Board that you can feed moves to update the position / FEN. This is not consistent and you may need to regenerate.

**PROMPT** (GPT3.5 can generate the board, but 4 can interact)

> FEN: "r1bqk2[r/p1ppbppp](/r/p1ppbppp/)/1pn2n2/4p1N1/2B1P3/3P4/PPP2PPP/RNBQK2R w KQkq - 0 6"

> use the FEN and algebraic letter notation to create a markdown table of the current board position. Each piece must always be in it's correct location according to the FEN/updated position. after every update check each square to ensure it is the correct piece and that each square has a piece if the FEN dictates it should. co-ordinates start bottom left a1 with the white player on the bottom and black at the top. each cell in the table must centre align its contents. your response must only include the table.

> the header and first column of the table are not positions on the board and should not be counted as squares.

> I will then respond with a legal move for the current player. update the piece on the table to the correct co-ordinate position with white on the bottom. remove the piece that moved from the old square

**OUTPUT**  
[Chess Board](https://i.imgur.com/u7In478.png)

**Updating the Board**  
GPT 4 can now take a move and update the board and the FEN. GPT3.5 gets confused here and the co-ordinates get messed up ( i think it's a board orientation thing based on current player)

    Svelte is a radical new approach to building user interfaces. Whereas traditional frameworks like React and Vue do the bulk of their work in the browser, Svelte shifts that work into a compile step that happens when you build your app. Instead of using techniques like virtual DOM diffing, Svelte writes code that surgically updates the DOM when the state of your app changes.
