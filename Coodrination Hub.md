Goal: 
- Create a LK99 knowledge graph to facilitate the coordination of efforts in pushing said research forward.
- leverage Obsidian.md + Carlos’ AI embeds to visual and establish said coordination graph. (May have potential synergies with Lateral.io)
- Create a DeSci LK99 github repo that will underlie the DeSci LK99 obsidian.md graph.
    - it will be the place where groups push their respective notes too which will then feed the consolidate DeSci LK99 graph

DSW Tasks:
- Create Github repo to consolidate that the groups can push their LK99 notes to (Carolina)
- Create a DSW Obsidian.md 
- Reach out to Lateral.io and see if they would like to come on board (Jelani)
- Draft a workshop to explain to the research groups how they can contribute their notes ( @At0xNQ @JBate7 )
- Write a short but engaging piece on what we are doing here as a CTA to draw more interest.
- Reach out to and share the write up with Eiri and other players potentially interested in contributing (Jelani, Josh, etc)
