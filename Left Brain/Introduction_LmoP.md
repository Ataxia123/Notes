# Introduction

This book is written for the Dungeon Master. It contains a complete Dungeons & Dragons adventure, as well as descriptions for every creature and magic item that appears in the adventure. It also introduces the world of the Forgotten Realms, one of the game's most enduring settings, and it teaches you how to run a D&D game.

The smaller book that accompanies this one (hereafter called "the rulebook") contains the rules you need to adjudicate situations that arise during the adventure.

### Running the Adventure

Lost Mine of Phandelver is an adventure for four to five characters of 1st level. During the course of the adventure, the characters will advance to 5th level. The adventure is set a short distance from the city of Neverwinter in the Sword Coast region of the Forgotten Realms setting. The Sword Coast is part of the Northâ€”a vast realm of free settlements surrounded by wilderness and adventure. You don't need to be a Forgotten Realms expert to run the adventure; everything you need to know about the setting is contained in this book.

If this is your first time running a D&D adventure, read "The Dungeon Master" section; it will help you better understand your role and responsibilities.

The "Background" section tells you everything you need to know to set up the adventure. The "Overview" section describes how the adventure is expected to run and gives you a broad sense of what the player characters should be doing at any given time.
