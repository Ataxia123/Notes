**Backstory/Personality** (Just a quick idea, expand as you wish): Thalor was once a guardian of the vast Elven forests, which were frequently raided by orc warbands. Over time, his deep connection to the woods and his encounters with orcs honed his skills. He's quiet, always listening and observing before acting. Thalor cherishes the silent moments in the wilderness, finding them to be a stark contrast to the loud and chaotic skirmishes against his foes.
