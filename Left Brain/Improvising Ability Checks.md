#### Improvising Ability Checks

The adventure often tells you what ability checks characters might try in a certain situation and the Difficulty Class (DC) of those checks. Sometimes adventurers try things that the adventure can't possibly anticipate. It's up to you to decide whether their attempts are successful. If it seems like anyone should have an easy time doing it, don't ask for an ability check; just tell the player what happens. Likewise, if there's no way anyone could accomplish the task, just tell the player it doesn't work.

Otherwise, answer these three simple questions:

- What kind of ability check?
- How hard is it?
- What's the result?

Use the descriptions of the ability scores and their associated skills in the rulebook to help you decide what kind of ability check to use. Then determine how hard the task is so that you can set the DC for the check. The higher the DC, the more difficult the task. The easiest way to set a DC is to decide whether the task's difficulty is easy, moderate, or hard, and use these three DCs:

- **Easy (DC 10)**. An easy task requires a minimal level of competence or a modicum of luck to accomplish.
- **Moderate (DC 15)**. A moderate task requires a slightly higher level of competence to accomplish. A character with a combination of natural aptitude and specialized training can accomplish a moderate task more often than not.
- **Hard (DC 20)**. Hard tasks include any effort that is beyond the capabilities of most people without aid or exceptional ability.

Even with aptitude and training, a character needs some amount of luck—or a lot of specialized training—to pull off a hard task.

The outcome of a successful check is usually easy to determine: the character succeeds at whatever he or she set out to accomplish, within reason. It's usually equally easy to figure out what happens when a character fails a check: the character simply doesn't succeed.
