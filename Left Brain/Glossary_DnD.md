#### Glossary

The adventure uses terms that might be unfamiliar to you. A few of these terms are described here. For descriptions of rules-specific terms, see the rulebook.

**Characters.** This term refers to the adventurers run by the players. They are the protagonists in any D&D adventure. A group of characters or adventurers is called a party.

**Nonplayer Characters (NPCs).** This term refers to characters run by the DM. How an NPC behaves is dictated by the adventure and by the DM.

**Boxed Text.** At various places, the adventure presents descriptive text that's meant to be read or paraphrased aloud to players. This read-aloud text is offset in boxes. Boxed text is most commonly used to describe rooms or present bits of scripted dialogue.

**Stat Block.** Any monster or NPC that is likely to be involved in combat requires game statistics so that the DM can run it effectively. These statistics are presented in a format called a statistics block, or stat block. You'll find the stat blocks needed for this adventure in appendix B.

**Tenday.** In the Forgotten Realms, a week is ten days long and called a tenday. Each month consists of three tendaysâ€”thirty days total.

#### Magic Items and Monsters

Whenever the text refers to a magic item, its name is presented in italic type. For a description of the item and its magical properties, see appendix A.

Similarly, whenever the adventure text presents a creature's name in bold type, that's a visual cue directing you to the creature's game statistics in appendix B.
