Networking hardware refers to the physical devices and equipment used in computer networks to facilitate communication and data transfer between devices. Some common types of networking hardware include:

1. [[Network Interface Cards]] (NICs): These are expansion cards or built-in components that enable devices to connect to a network. NICs provide a physical interface for devices to transmit and receive data over a network.

2. [[Switches]]: Switches are devices that connect multiple devices within a local area network (LAN). They receive data packets and forward them to the appropriate destination device based on the MAC address.

3. Routers: Routers are devices that connect multiple networks together, such as connecting a local network to the internet. They use routing tables to determine the best path for data packets to reach their destination.

4. Modems: Modems are used to connect a computer or network to an internet service provider (ISP) via a telephone line, cable, or fiber optic connection. They convert digital signals from the computer into analog signals that can be transmitted over the communication medium.

5. Firewalls: Firewalls are security devices that monitor and control incoming and outgoing network traffic. They help protect networks from unauthorized access and potential threats by enforcing security policies.

6. Wireless Access Points (WAPs): WAPs enable wireless devices to connect to a wired network. They provide wireless connectivity by transmitting and receiving data over radio waves.

7. Network Cables: Various types of cables, such as Ethernet cables, fiber optic cables, and coaxial cables, are used to connect networking devices and transmit data between them.

8. Network Hubs: Hubs are older networking devices that connect multiple devices within a LAN. However, unlike switches, hubs do not have the ability to intelligently forward data packets and instead broadcast all data to all connected devices.

These are just a few examples of networking hardware. The specific hardware used in a network depends on the network's size, requirements, and technology used.
