A biological neural network refers to the interconnected system of neurons found in the nervous system of living organisms, including humans. It is the fundamental structure responsible for processing and transmitting information within the body. In the context of #At0x research, a biological neural network may be studied to understand its functioning and to develop artificial neural networks that mimic its behavior. These artificial neural networks can be used in various applications such as machine learning, pattern recognition, and data analysis.
