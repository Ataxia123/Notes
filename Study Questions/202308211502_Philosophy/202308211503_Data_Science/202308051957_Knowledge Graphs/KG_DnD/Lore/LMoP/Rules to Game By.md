##### Rules to Game By
>
>As the Dungeon Master, you are the final authority when it comes to rules questions or disputes. Here are some guidelines to help you arbitrate issues as they come up.
>
>- **When in doubt, make it up!** It's better to keep the game moving than to get bogged down in the rules.
>- **It's not a competition** The DM isn't competing against the player characters. You're there to run the monsters, referee the rules, and keep the story moving.
>- **It's a shared story** It's the group's story, so let the players contribute to the outcome through the actions of their characters. Dungeons & Dragons is about imagination and coming together to tell a story as a group. Let the players participate in the storytelling.
>- **Be consistent** If you decide that a rule works a certain way in one session, make sure it works that way the next time it comes into play.
>- **Make sure everyone is involved** Ensure every character has a chance to shine. If some players are reluctant to speak up, remember to ask them what their characters are doing.
>- **Be fair** Use your powers as Dungeon Master only for good. Treat the rules and the players in a fair and impartial manner.
>- **Pay attention** Make sure you look around the table occasionally to see if the game is going well. If everyone seems to be having fun, relax and keep going. If the fun is waning, it might be time for a break, or you can try to liven things up.
