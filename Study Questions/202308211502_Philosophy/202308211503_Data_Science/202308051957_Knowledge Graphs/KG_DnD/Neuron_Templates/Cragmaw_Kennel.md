**The Kennel** (Area 3, pg. 8 LMOP)**:** If one of the goblins from the blind makes it to the kennel, the wolves will be freed one by one each round to attack the players as the enter the area of the path at the kennel's entrance.

If the goblin sentries from the blind are eliminated or escape into the thicket, the players find the wolves tethered to an iron spike in the kennel, snarling and fighting with each other.

Certain as sunrise, once the wolves are discovered, the immediate thought for many players will be to simply feather them with arrows and be done with them - which I hate. Yes, there's an escape mechanism built into the encounter for the wolves to break loose from the tether and get at the party; but it's been my experience that by the time the wolves break free, they're all a HP away from becoming pelts. As a DM, I'll go out of my way to lead players to the option of taming the wolves with food by asking any player with proficiency in Nature to make a DC 12 check. A successful result reveals the wolves have an unhealthy look to them; the outline of their ribs visible through their fur, as if they were starving, etc.

If the players decide to tame the wolves through a successful DC 10 Intelligence (Animal Handing) check using food, I'll award inspiration and XP to the players, to illustrate the point that every solution doesn't need to involve bloodshed.

Of course, if the players leave the wolves unharmed, no good deed goes unpunished. If the the goblin sentries from area 2 escaped into the thicket during the previous encounter, they've been known to arrive as reinforcements at some point later in the Cragmaw Hideout, with the wolves in tow.

**Steep Passage** (Area 4, pg. 9 LMOP): If one of the goblin sentries from area 2 escapes to the western passage with players in pursuit, he will attempt to alert the goblins in area 6 by climbing the escarpments. The area is treated as difficult terrain, so the goblin will use his move action to get as far as the ledge between the escarpments and then, emboldened by having the higher ground and a debris field between himself and any pursuer, loose an arrow at the first player to enter the western passage.

If a player making a ranged attack picks off the goblin at the ledge before he can climb the second escarpment, it's the perfect opportunity to work the fragile ledge seamlessly into the game if a player is interested in rooting through the dead goblin's pockets. Be sure to have a vivid description of the color, weight and texture of pocket lint they just found in the goblin's pocket as they're rolling their DEX save and bludgeoning damage when the ledge comes crashing down.

Pursuit of the goblin to the western passage also has effect of attracting the attention of the goblin sentry on the bridge at area 5. If the players are busy with their pursuit, I give the goblin on the bridge advantage on his stealth check to slink across the bridge for the purposes of alert the goblins in area 7 to unleash the flood, as well as Klarg in area 8. More on that when I get around to writing _LMOP: Dungeon Master's Guide To The Cragmaw Hideout - Part II_

**Take Note:** in a situation where the goblins in area 2 become aware of the players and rush into the cave, the Cragmaw Hideout becomes more a chain of events, rather than a room-by-room search and destroy mission for the party. With the goblin sentries alert and attempting to raise the defenses, areas 1-4 and 5, 7 & 8 all become active at once!

- Players arrive in area 1
    
- Alert goblins in area 2 spot players in area 1, rush to alert others via area 4, and unleash defenses in area 3.
    
- Players in pursuit of goblin to area 4 unwittingly alert goblin guard on the bridge in area 5, who slinks off to alert goblins manning the flood trap in area 7, and the boss in area 8
