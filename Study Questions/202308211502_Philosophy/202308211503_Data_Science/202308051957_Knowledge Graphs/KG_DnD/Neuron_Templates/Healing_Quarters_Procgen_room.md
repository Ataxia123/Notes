# ProcGen_Rooms

1. Name: The Healing Quarters
2. Description: The room is filled with a serene, calming aura. The air is laced with the sweet scent of various healing herbs and incense. Sunlight pours through the sole tall window in the room, casting a warm golden glow across the room. Here, weary adventurers come to rest and recuperate. Shelves packed with diverse potions, phials, and unguents stand on one side of the room, and opposite are several cots covered in soft, clean linens for those needing to recover from their battles. A low wooden table stands in the middle of the room, covered in bandages, tinctures, and several medical books. 
3. Alternate Descriptions: 
  - At Dusk: Shadows creep across the chamber as the sun sets, turning the room a dusky gold. It is quieter now, calm before the storm of potential night injuries.
  - During Rush: When too many need aid, the room is a flurry of activity. The healers here are efficient, though, dealing quickly and compassionately with both life-threatening wounds and minor scrapes.
4. Interactions: 
  - A player can converse with the healers, and learn about the healing arts.
  - A player can seek healing here, either free if they lack coin but are fast friends of the healers, or for a fee if they are well off.
  - Searching the shelves could reveal rare medicinal plants or recipes for potent potions.
5. Ambiance Sounds: Soothing chanting, subtle crackling of incense, rustling of pages from the medical books being turned, murmur of patients and healers.

6. Entities:
  - **NPC - Healer:** Has knowledge regarding healing and potions. Can engage in trade with the players.
  - **Enemy - Wounded Enemy:** A wounded enemy seeking refuge under the guise of a patient. Could be discovered if the players dig deeper.
  - **Items - Healing Potions, Medical books, Bandages**

The room can play a vital role in the campaign as it provides the needed healing, possibly necessary information about enemies, and an opportunity to engage in trade. It's also a surefire place the party would return to, thus creating a repeating character in the form of the healer and giving the world a more alive feeling.
