HEX is a blockchain-based project on the Ethereum (ERC20) network developed by Richard Heart in 2019. 

1. Supply Details:

   The maximum supply of HEX is capped at 630,859,409,283 tokens. Due to the staking mechanism, in which users are rewarded for locking up their tokens for a specific duration, the circulating supply of HEX tokens varies.

2. Structure of Distribution:

   HEX was launched by an airdrop to Bitcoin holders. After the airdrop, tokens were primarily distributed to those who chose to "lock" their Bitcoin to receive HEX.

3. Token Utility:

   The HEX token primarily serves two purposes. First, it is designed as a store of value, which continues to accumulate more HEX based on the length of the staking period. Second, it acts as a speculative token, with price fluctuations driven by market supply and demand dynamics.

4. Staking Mechanism:

   HEX incentivizes long-term holding by rewarding stakers (those who lock their tokens) more favorably. The longer the stake period, the higher the returns. If holders "end stake" before their time is up, a "penalty" is charged.

5. Inflation Rate:

   HEX is designed to offer high-interest rates to stakers. The standard inflation rate is approximately 3.69% per annum.

6. Governance:

   HEX does not possess any explicit governance structure or offer governance rights to token holders. Its "game-theoretic" model aims to make it a decentralized, autonomous system post-launch.

Please keep in mind that before investing in any project, it's essential to do thorough research and take into account the volatility and risks associated with the cryptocurrency market.
