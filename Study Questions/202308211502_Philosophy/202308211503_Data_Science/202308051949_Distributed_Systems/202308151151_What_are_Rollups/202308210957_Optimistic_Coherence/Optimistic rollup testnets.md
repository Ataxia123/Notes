### Optimistic rollup testnets 

A [testnet](https://www.alchemy.com/overviews/what-are-testnets) is a public blockchain network that simulates the behavior of an associated main network (Mainnet). Testnets don't use real funds, unlike a real blockchain, allowing developers to deploy and test smart contracts with minimal risk. 

Some optimistic rollups have versions of Ethereum testnets, like [Rinkeby](https://www.alchemy.com/overviews/rinkeby-testnet), which can use for testing your dApp:  

#### 1. Optimism Ethereum Kovan Testnet 

The Optimistic Ethereum Kovan Testnet is an EVM-compatible optimistic rollup chain designed for testing purposes. Like Optimism on Ethereum Mainnet, the Optimistic Ethereum Kovan Testnet is designed for faster and cheaper transactions than obtainable on L1s. 

#### 2. Arbitrum Rinkeby Testnet

Offchain Labs, the team behind Arbitrum, launched an EVM-equivalent rollup chain on the Rinkeby network. The Arbitrum Rinkeby testnet allows developers to deploy Solidity smart contracts on the Arbitrum rollup without downloading software. It also comes with a blockchain explorer and a bridge for moving ERC-20/ERC-721 tokens. 

#### 3. Boba Network Rinkeby Testnet 

Boba Network is another project with an EVM-compatible rollup chain on the Rinkeby testnet. You can request testnet ETH with Alchemy's [Rinkeby faucet](https://rinkebyfaucet.com) to create or test your smart contracts.
