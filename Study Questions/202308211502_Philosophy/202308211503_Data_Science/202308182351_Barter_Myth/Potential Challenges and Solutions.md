### Potential Challenges and Solutions

As promising as this model may sound, challenges arise, specifically regarding the 'Tragedy of the Commons,' whereby individual interests may lead to the exploitation or depletion of shared resources. To address this, efficient regulation and management systems need to be in place.

Moreover, tokenized incentives may engender their own set of complications. For instance, incentivizing contributions could lead to individuals prioritizing reward-oriented tasks at the expense of overall welfare. To avoid such occurrences, allocations should reflect societal values and prioritize communal welfare over individual rewards.

Hyperstructures can form the backbone that supports such an intricate system, ensuring efficient asset management, fair resource allocation, active contribution, and sustainable use of resources.

In conclusion, through the power of hyperstructures, an innovative, symbiotic economic model blending market economies with public good-based economies seems feasible. With careful planning, regulation, and efficient use of the knowledge graph hyperstructure, the economic system could evolve into an inclusive, sustainable and dynamic structure that benefits all members of society.
