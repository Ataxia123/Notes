Gamma: Hey guys, sorry to interrupt, but couldn't help overhearing your conversation. I think I might have a solution.

Alpha: Really? I'm all ears!

Gamma: Ever heard of Knowledge Graphs?

Beta: Sounds familiar, but refresh my memory.

Gamma: Knowledge Graphs are a sort of database.  They are designed to store structured and unstructured information and define relationships between data in a way traditional databases can't. They are essentially graph structures for semantic queries. And the best part, they can be applied to our crypto system.

Alpha: You got my attention. How could it be applied to our issue here?

Gamma: There are a few ways. Say you want to find someone whoâ€™s interested in your NFTs, right? We could create a knowledge graph that stores information about different users of this virtual space. We could record what kind of transactions they prefer, what digital assets they own, and what they're potentially interested in. This way, you'd be able to find a match for your NFTs more easily.

Beta: Sounds promising. But how does that change the current system?

Gamma: For starters, this knowledge graph could also help us understand how value is transferred and transformed in our community. We could see and understand the movement of assets and wealth. We could identify areas of imbalance and inequality so we might take collective action to address them. 

Alpha: Wow, that might just be a game-changer. Like a metaverse supported by a semantic web.

Gamma: Exactly! This is how Knowledge Graphs can bring about something more than just transactional relationships and create a real community, even in our digital world.

Alpha: Impressive. Where can we learn more about this?

Gamma: There are plenty of resources out there. Here's a paper named "Knowledge Graphs: New Directions for Knowledge Representation on the Semantic Web" by Domingue et. al. They've done an extensive job explaining the concept and potential applications of Knowledge Graphs. Similarly, "Knowledge Graph and Semantic Computing: A Survey of the State Of The Art" by Jiawei et. al offers a comprehensive overview of state-of-the-art techniques and upcoming trends of Knowledge Graphs and semantic computing. 

Beta: You've given us something to think about, Gamma. We'll dive into those papers. Thanks!

Gamma: My pleasure! It's about time we evolve and create a more balanced crypto ecosystem.
