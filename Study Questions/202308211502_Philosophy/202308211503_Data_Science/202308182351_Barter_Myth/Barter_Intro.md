# Barter_Background

Before diving deeper into the relationship between barter, money, and coordination, it's essential to piece together the historical and economic background of these concepts. 

Most classic theories stem from assertions by prominent intellectuals such as Aristotle and Adam Smith. They outlined theories suggesting a world in which barter economy was the norm before the introduction of money. 

According to Adam Smith's theory on barter, goods and services' exchange was a cumbersome process, often leading to the 'double coincidence of wants' problem. It's the dilemma where two parties may not precisely require what the other offers, complicating trade.

Aristotle, another philosopher credited with early economic theories, echoed the same sentiment. His writings often named barter as the precursor to money. However, his views, as are Smith's, are marred with the absence of definitive historical evidence.

Other economists have also previously expressed similar views on the sequence of economic systems, suggesting a linear trend from barter to monetary systems. 

Fascinatingly, anthropological observations on non-monetary economies, particularly in societies untouched by modern civilization, suggest scenarios of gift economies and reciprocity, challenging the traditional perspective. These observations underscore the need to explore the actual practice of barter through history and decode its interaction with concepts like coordination and money. 

An understanding of these historical roots will cast light on the evolutionary pathway of trade, thereby generating a detailed perspective on the present and future implications of barter, money, and coordination.
