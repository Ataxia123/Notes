# How to create your own Obsidian Plugin

The Obsidian Developers imagined Obsidian as an IDE for Thoughts and Notes, which makes it super extensible by design.

Obsidian is made using Web Technologies, or more specificly [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), HTML, and CSS. The Desktop Application uses [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/) and thus also [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/) under the Hood, while the Mobile Apps are using [CapacitorJS](https://capacitorjs.com/).

In this Post we will be recreating one of my first Obsidian Plugins, [Cycle through Panes](https://github.com/phibr0/cycle-through-panes).
