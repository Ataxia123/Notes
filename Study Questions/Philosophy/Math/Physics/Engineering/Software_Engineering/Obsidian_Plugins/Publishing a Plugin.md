# Publishing a Plugin

Now everything that‚Äôs left to do is publish the Plugin. This involves 4 Steps, filling out the manifest.json, pushing the Code to GitHub, creating a Release on GitHub and finally making a Pull Request to the obsidian-releases Repository with your Plugin‚Äôs information.

## Filling out the manifest

The Manifest has 8 fields, the _id_ and _name_, which is almost the same as in a Command, the _version_, which needs to follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/), the _minAppVersion_, which is the minimal Obsidian Version that your Plugin depends on, this might change if Obsidian‚Äôs API changes. A _description_ which is used for the search in the Plugin Browser, the _author_ and _authorUrl_, which should be you and your website or GitHub Profile and lastly the _isDesktopOnly_ field, which needs to be set to true if your Plugin interacts with NodeJS or you are are relying on CodeMirror 5.

## Pushing to GitHub

This Step is super easy if you already created a Repository in the first Step of this Article. Just run the following Commands:

## Creating a Release on GitHub

On the right hand side, click on ‚ÄúCreate new Release‚Äù. Inside the ‚ÄúChoose a Tag‚Äù field add the current version of your Plugin without a v at the front. This needs to match your manifest.json. If you want you can add a description and a Title, but thats optional. What you will need to do, is adding the main.js (run _npm run build_ to compile it) , manifest.json and if you have one styles.css at the bottom. Once you are ready, hit ‚ÄúPublish Release‚Äù.

## Adding the Plugin to the Community Plugins

Go to the official Obsdian-Releases Repository and [open the Community Plugins File](https://github.com/obsidianmd/obsidian-releases/blob/master/community-plugins.json). On the top right hit Edit and add your Plugin to the end of the List like so:
