### General Features

The Cragmaw cave slopes steeply upward. The entrance is at the foot of a good-sized hill, and the caves and passages are inside the hill itself.

***Ceilings.*** Most of the caves and passages have steeply sloping ceilings that create stalactite-covered vaults rising 20 to 30 feet above the floor.

***Light.*** Areas 1 and 2 are outside. The rest of the complex is dark unless stated otherwise. The boxed text for those locations assumes that the characters have darkvision or a light source.

***Rubble.*** Areas of crumbling rock and gravel are difficult terrain (see "Difficult Terrain" in the rulebook).

***Sound.*** The sound of water in the cave muffles noises to any creatures that aren't listening carefully. Creatures can make a DC 15 Wisdom (Perception) check to attempt to hear activity in nearby chambers.

***Stalagmites.*** These upthrust spires of rock can provide cover (see "Cover" in the rulebook).

***Stream.*** The stream that flows through the complex is only 2 feet deep, cold, and slow moving, allowing creatures to easily wade through it.
