Introducing "Ludus ChampionFunds", a revolutionary approach to sports funding. By leveraging the power of quadratic funding, we can democratize the support for athletes and empower the sports community to contribute to their success. 

Here's how it works: 

1. Athletes create profiles on Ludus, outlining their training needs, goals, and upcoming competitions. 
2. The community contributes to these athletes, with every donation, big or small, making a significant impact. 
3. Ludus ChampionFunds matches these donations, amplifying the total funding each athlete receives. 
4. Once the athlete succeeds, Ludus ChampionFunds receives a 20% return on the investment over the next 2 years. 
5. This 20% return is then split between the original investors and Ludus ChampionFunds, providing a return on investment for all parties involved.

This model not only provides much-needed support for athletes but also creates a sustainable funding mechanism that benefits the entire sports ecosystem and rewards those who contribute to it.
