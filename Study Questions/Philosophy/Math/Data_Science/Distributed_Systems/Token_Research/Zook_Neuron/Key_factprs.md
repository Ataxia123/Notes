1. **Key Factors in Token Grading:**
   The key factors to consider when grading tokens usually involve an examination of the following characteristics:
      - **Market Capitalization:** The total value held in a cryptocurrency. It is calculated by multiplying the total supply of coins by the current price of an individual unit. This metric is commonly used to measure a cryptocurrency's relative size.
      - **Liquidity:** This refers to the ability to convert a cryptocurrency into cash or other forms without affecting its market price. High liquidity typically means high trade volume and successful exchanges.
      - **Community/ Social Media Engagement:** A strong and active community around a cryptocurrency can be a strong indicator of its health and longevity.
      - **Developer Activity:** How active are the coders in developing the project and software? Regular updates might be a good sign.
      - **Adoption and Technology:** This comprises both the use cases of the project and the technology that supports it. Are people using it, and is the platform robust and scalable?
      - **Regulatory Compliance:** Depending on region, this can impact the usability and even legality of certain cryptocurrencies.

2. **Metrics for Success:**
   Success for cryptocurrencies can be gauged using the following metrics: 
      - **Price Performance:** Over different time periods, across different exchange platforms.
      - **Market Share:** Indicates how much of the total cryptocurrency market a single cryptocurrency holds. 
      - **Return on Investment (ROI):** This measures the price performance of a token relative to its initial offering price.
      - **Onchain Data:**
          - Transactions count and volume: The number of transactions happening on the blockchain.
          - Active addresses: The number of unique addresses that are actively sending/receiving the token.

3. **Hidden Insights:**
   Deep-dives into analyzing other aspects: 
      - Critical analysis of the team behind the project. 
      - Assessment of the project whitepaper for viability and innovation.
      - Research the partnerships and affiliations to judge the project's positioning in the field.

4. **Strategic Advantage:**
   Strategic advantages can be derived from understanding the project's unique selling proposition and how it separates itself from the competition relating to the use cases it is aiming to solve in the crypto space.

Different projects might score differently depending on the weighting value given to each of these factors. Therefore, there's a certain degree of subjectivity in the grading systems for tokens and cryptocurrencies.
