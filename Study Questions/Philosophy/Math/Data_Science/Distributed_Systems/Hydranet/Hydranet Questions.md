## Hydranet Questions

What Does Hydranet Offer Solutions For?

Hydranet offers solutions to the most important problems of blockchain technology with Layer 3 DEX. As a blockchain grows in popularity and demand, heavy network traffic can lead to serious congestion problems that cause transaction fees and confirmation wait times to increase astronomically. This is where Hydranet comes in. Its approach of strictly using Layer 2 assets results in very low transaction fees, nearly-instantaneous speeds, and the possibility of exchanging real assets that exist independently from one another and have no direct bridge. Check out the DEX page for more details.

What Are the Hydranet Team's Experiences?

The Hydranet team is made up of a diverse group of volunteers, most of whom dedicate their time to development and management despite also working full-time jobs. If you would like to learn more about individual team members and their respective backgrounds and work experiences, you can read about them in a three-part series: [Part I](https://medium.com/@Hydranet/meet-the-hydranet-team-part-1-93e990ca6d66) , [Part II](https://medium.com/@Hydranet/meet-the-hydranet-team-part-ii-25f61b9ee21e) , [Part III](https://medium.com/@Hydranet/meet-the-hydranet-team-part-iii-af3b249f682b)

Where Can I Find the Roadmap?

The detailed roadmap is available here on our website, hydranet.ai. Currently, the DEX is undergoing major ugprades from its first public testnet build (Lazarus). When these upgrades have been implemented successfully, our second testnet build (Atlas) will debut publicly (Q4 2022). After this we will move to Mainnet, this version will be called Phoenix (Date TBA).

What is the Purpose of the HDN Token?

HDN is the governance token for the Hydranet project. In addition to voting, HDN holders will benefit from the trades on the DEX by the design of our [Tokenomics](https://hydranet.ai/en/tokenomics). By offering HDN sales in the form of bonds directly from the Hydranet website, the team is able to raise funds for development, infrastructure, and marketing. Hydranet is and always has been community-driven, and we cannot overstate our gratitude for all the support we've received.

## Community Questions

What is the Purpose of the Community?

Hydranet is a community-based, DAO-controlled project that draws its core strengths from its dedicated, organic following. The community serves as the DAOs support network, and vice-versa. Important decisions are made by community voting. Business plans and goals are relayed by the team to the community on both an as-needed basis and in the form of weekly and monthly project status updates. The community, in turn, provides feedback, votes with their wallets, and proposes ideas for future votes. You too can be part of the Hydranet community.

What is DAO and How Does It Work?

"DAO" is short for "Decentralized Autonomous Organization". Hydranet is managed through cooperation between the community and the Hydranet team. Proposals are arranged on the Snapshot platform so that HDN holders can vote on important topics, and the team then implements those decisions accordingly.

How Can I Help?

By joining the community, you can be involved in the decision-making process at its most basic level. Much of our content production, moderation, and social media management has come from volunteers. We have international community represantatives for an impressive number of countries and languages. These efforts significantly enhance communication between the team and community itself. We invite you to join the Hydranet Discord channel and try out the testnet DEX for yourself!

How Does It Benefit Me?

Hydranet DEX is a groundbreaking project for the cryptocurrency ecosystem. By joining the community, you stand to witness this revolution up close. With the release of Phoenix version of the Hydranet DEX, a lot will change, see our [Tokenomics](https://hydranet.ai/en/tokenomics). Depending on the needs of the project and your areas of expertise, you may also be a fit for our team.
