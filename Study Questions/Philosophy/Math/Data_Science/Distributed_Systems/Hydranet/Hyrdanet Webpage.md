WHAT IS HYDRANET

## Hydranet offers the World's First Layer 3 DEX

Hydranet's Layer 3 technology facilitates communication between Bitcoin and Ethereum, two fundamentally different blockchains, enabling seamless interoperability.

### Speed and Scalability

Hydranet reduces network load without compromising security. The average transaction settlement time is merely 1 second.

### Interoperability

Hydranet doesn’t require wrapped tokens. Native assets can seamlessly be exchanged between different chains without the need for a Layer 2 bridge.

COMMUNITY POWER

## A Decentralized and Autonomous Organization

Hydranet derives its strength from the community. In addition to voting and governance, the HDN token price will appreciate with every trade on the DEX using buybacks for liquidity and burn mechanisms.

### HDN Holder Benefits

Hydranet is committed to never having custody over user funds and to share the success of the DEX with the community through unique Tokenomics.

### HDN Loyalty Shares

After launch, we are planning to create Loyalty Rewards for Users & Community. Being an early supporter of Hydranet will not be in vain! Stay tuned.
