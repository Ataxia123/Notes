in this video I want to start to talk about some of the main concepts that are covered in chapter 1 of the textbook and I'm not going to get into all of the details that they cover in the chapter so it's still important to read the text but hopefully I can give you the big picture and the main ideas so that when you read those details you have some sort of a framework to put them into so the big picture of course is that we are talking about we are talking about research methods so this class is all about the techniques the methods that people have developed over the years for how to do research how to try to find things out about the world and of course this class is specifically focused on research methods for psychology for psychology so that means that in some cases we're going to be looking at specifically how do you find things out about about how people think so about thought and about behavior why do people think the way they think why do people do the things they do how do you do good research to find answers to those kinds of questions so to some extent we're going to get into things specifically about psychology but actually a lot of the stuff a great deal of what we talk about is just going to be stuff that you would run into the same the same techniques the same methods the same issues and problems that you would run into if you were doing research in really any area so so in many ways you can just think of this as science class this is about how to do scientific research now the first thing that the textbook authors are going to try to convince you of since we're going to spend the rest of the semester talking about research methods they're going to try to convince you that it's useful and that is the whole first section is trying to show you why why would you be why would you want to study research methods because obviously a lot of you are just in this class because it's a requirement if you're wanting to major in psychology you have to take research methods but why might it be useful and there are lots of reasons for this a for example you know of course if you're if you're doing research yourself if you are actually going to do research obviously you need to know research methods now if you're saying well I'm not planning on becoming a researcher I'm going to go into clinical psychology I'm going to become a therapist or something like that but I'm not I'm not planning on doing research well even if you're not planning on having a career in research you might still want to consider doing some research as a student so you may not be aware but there there is a class at NAU called called psych 485 and basically what you do in insight 45 is you sign up with a particular professor who's doing some kind of research that hopefully you're you're interested in and usually you can kind of look around to see what the different teachers at the University are doing their research in and you pick someone that you're interested in working with and you actually get to as you know the class is not a sit down in a lecture room kind of a class but in actual working with the teacher with other students on real research that the professor is probably going to try to get published and so you have an opportunity to get involved in research and even if you're not particularly interested in that you know it's a really good thing to have on your resume under on your CV if you are one to get a job coming out of school or or you're in particular if you're wanting to go on to graduate school in psychology having research research experience is really useful for that especially if you're able to if you know your research methods really well you do a really good job and impress the the professor they're going to be more likely to write to a really awesome letter of recommendation going into into graduate school so that's one potential reason why this might be useful another one and it's simply that you know if you're able to and understand scientific research that means you rely less on others in other words you're able to interpret research for yourself your research for yourself you're able to decide for yourself whether you think a particular finding is valid or whether you know how what it means rather than relying on friends or in particular the news media we have - we read about scientific studies in the news and they're very often given some level of interpretation so the journalists will have to summarize what the study means and in doing so they often get it wrong or they often exaggerate some part of it and if you can actually go back and look at the research yourself if it's something that matters to you that's a really useful skill to have another thing they talk about in the book is the idea that you often see these abbreviated descriptions of research so you'll hear something like there was a study that involved a randomized controlled trial or there was a longitudinal study or a correlation was found a negative correlation was found between height and income when you hear things like that after you've gone through this class you'll you'll know the lingo so it's useful for knowing knowing the vocabulary or knowing the lingo the jargon that scientists use so that when you hear an abbreviated description of a study you know what they're talking about another side effect of of having experience with research methods is if you know you can how should I put this more easily win arguments with friends when arguments with friends or I should say win but more resolve you can more easily more effectively resolve disagreements that you have about something you know after taking research methods after getting experience with how science is done I've found that I very often when I'm getting into an argument when I'm getting into a disagreement with someone I'll realize that I don't really have enough information to to justify my opinion and the other person I'm talking to doesn't really have enough information to justify their opinion and so after this what I think you'll find is that you very often will say hey we don't have the data we don't have the research in front of us to really know what we think about this I'm inclined to to lean in this direction you're inclined to lean in that direction but we don't really know let's actually go out and look at it and see if there's any research that's been done and and if there has been can it resolve our disagreement and sometimes you'll find that you're right and then you'll find that you're wrong sometimes you'll find that you're both right or both wrong or that you know maybe the the the real state of the world is something you hadn't even thought of so being able to do that is really helpful you know we could go on all day about all of these different potential reasons why it can be useful but what I would say is that the overarching reason why research methods is incredibly good to know is because it gives you a more realistic understanding of the world it will help you to you know the whole purpose of research methods is to help you get at the truth to help you more accurately understand what is actually the state of reality and if you have a more you know if you if you're going about your life and you have an unrealistic understanding you don't really know how things are working and you have a lot of misconceptions the decisions you make are not going to be very good so the biggest thing that I would say is that knowing these techniques knowing how scientists approach these things it can genuinely make help you make I'm gonna say make better decisions in your life decisions that are based more closely on reality the last thing that I want to make sure to emphasize is that even if you are going into into clinical clinical psychology so you want to be a therapist or a counselor you might think well I don't really need to understand research methods I'm not going to be doing research it's not important for me to understand all this vocabulary these terms the different issues they come up with research I don't need to know that I very strongly believe that that is the complete opposite of the truth as a clinical psychologist you are going to be working with clients with patients who are in in some cases very bad shape who are you know you by definition they're coming to you because they need your help and you need to be up to date if you want to be the best the therapist be the most helpful to them and avoid doing real harm to them by accident you need to be up to date on the latest research you know that the human mind is this incredibly complicated thing and many conditions like PTSD schizophrenia we don't understand completely at all and we don't have all the information on what is the best way to treat these things but we do have a lot of cutting-edge research in these areas so if you want to be the most effective therapist you need to be up to date on what works and what doesn't and I can tell you from personal experience when I was a student I had a couple of different therapists that I went to and I can tell you from personal experience that they don't always keep up to date on the research and they don't always think about things scientifically and because of that their clinical approach their ability to have a real impact on their patients suffers so from my own personal experience I remember that sometimes they were very useful sometimes they use effective technique other times they would go off into stuff that had no basis in scientific research whatsoever then I was able to tell that even just as an undergraduate not even as an experienced scientist so even if you're going to clinical psychology it is absolutely essential that you have a good idea that you feel comfortable looking at a scientific study and that's one of my main goals in this class is to help you feel more comfortable to help you practice the vocabulary the concepts until they're no longer intimidating until they no longer make your brain hurt so that they become second nature and as familiar to you as anything else in your everyday life
