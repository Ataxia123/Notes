In this story, Alpha starts off by trying to barter an NFT artwork for Bitcoin or Ethereum with Beta. However, Beta isn't interested in the NFT and is instead focused on holding his Bitcoin position for an extended period. Gamma then enters the conversation and proposes the creation of a smart contract where everyone contributes to a shared pool of resources rather than engaging in one-to-one trading. This solution fosters a shared benefits approach and could potentially create a surplus-based society. Alpha embraces Gamma's idea, expressing hope for a future where blockchain's benefits are shared among all participants instead of concentrated in a few hands.
