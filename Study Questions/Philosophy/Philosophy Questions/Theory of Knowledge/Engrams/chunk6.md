Abstract
Research on the feeding habits of Franciscana dolphins in the Uruguayan coast was carried out
using stomach contents from dolphins which were incidentally entangled in artisanal fishing nets
and stranded on the beach. Stomach contents of 41 dolphins were analyzed in order to improve
knowledge about the feeding habits of this species. A total of nine food items were identified,
eight teleost and one squid species. Teleosts were recorded in 99.8% of the 41 stomachs
analyzed and corresponded to a total of 342 individuals. The striped weakfish Cynoscion
guatucupa, was the most important teleost (n = 127; %IRI = 49.43) followed by Porichthys
porosissimus (n = 90; %IRI = 26.61), and Micropogonias furnieri (n = 66; %IRI = 17.33),
whereas the remaining fish species represented less than 6.5 % of index of relative importance.
From eight species of fish found in the stomach, five of them actively produce sound: Cynoscion


guatucupa, Porichthys porosissimus, Micropogonias furnieri, Umbrina canossai and Macrodon
atricauda. Fishes, particularly those emitting sound, were the most important Franciscana food
item representing 97.4 % Index of Relative Importance. The Levin’s index standardized of niche
breadth show a specialist feeding strategy, and data present in this paper indicates that the
Franciscana dolphin in the Uruguayan coast chooses soniferous prey. Therefore, a way the
Franciscana finds the preys within dark waters like the Rio de la Plata estuary and the murky
waters of the Uruguayan oceanic coast could be through the passive listening.

Key words: Pontoporia blainvillei, diet, Uruguay coast, passive listening, soniferous fishes

Introduction
Understanding predator-prey relationships is one of the main goals of animal ecology.
Information on prey selection is often used to provide the foundation for dietary niche
characterization (Bearhop et al., 2004) and along with diet composition is one of the most
important input parameters in food web models (Christensen & Pauly 1992; Berens-McCabe et
al., 2010 ).
Cetacean diets are commonly quantified through stomach content analyses of stranded, by-
caught, or harvested animals (e.g., Fitch & Brownell 1971; Gannon et al., 1997; Barros & Wells
1998). The Franciscana dolphin (Pontoporia blainvillei, Gervais & d’Orbigny 1844) is an
endemic dolphin from the Southwestern Atlantic Ocean that is caught incidentally in coastal
fishing nets all along its geographical distribution (from Itaúnas (18°25’S, 30°42’W, Brazil) to


Península Valdés (42° 35 ́S, 64°48’W, Argentina) (Praderi et al., 1989; Secchi et al., 1997;
Crespo et al., 1998; Rodriguez et al., 2002; Bordino et al., 2002; Franco-Trecu et al., 2009). Due
to their continued incidental mortality throughout most of its distribution it is considered the
most endangered small cetacean of the Southwestern Atlantic Ocean (Secchi & Wang 2003).
Consequently, the Franciscana dolphin is classified as Vulnerable (A3d) by the International
Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN, Reeves et al., 2008). Little is known of the ecology
and behavior of individuals in the wild (Bordino et al., 2002; Crespo et al., 2010; Tellechea &
Norbis 2014).
Many studies on trophic ecology of the Franciscana dolphin have been performed in the
southwestern Atlantic Ocean region (Fitch & Brownell 1971; Pinedo 1982; Brownell 1989; Ott
1994; Rodríguez et al., 2002; Bassoi 2005; Paso-Viola et al., 2014). Studies of feeding habits
have found that this dolphin exhibits opportunistic feeding behavior and is a prey generalist,
consuming fish, cephalopods and crustaceans as the most common prey (Rodríguez et al., 2002;
Bassoi 2005; Paso-Viola et al., 2014). Like the bottlenose dolphin (Tursiops truncatus), the
Franciscana dolphin feeds on soniferous (i.e. noise-producing) fishes, particularly sciaenids
(Fitch & Brownell 1971; Brownell 1989; Rodríguez et al., 2002; Bassoi 2005; Cremer et al.,
2012; Paso-Viola et al.; 2014). This data would suggests that Franciscana select soniferous prey,
using passive listening to locate noise-producing prey but this has not been studied yet.
Some researchers have hypothesized that coastal bottlenose dolphins uses passive
listening to locate noise-producing prey (Barros & Odell 1990; Barros 1993; Barros & Wells
1998). In a novel experiment in Sarasota Bay, Gannon et al. (2005) found that bottlenose
dolphins indeed responded to the playback of fish sounds. The dolphins changed their direction


of travel, turning towards the sound source when fish noises were played. In addition, dolphins
significantly increased their rate of echolocation immediately following playback of fish sounds.
The authors concluded that bottlenose dolphins use passive listening extensively during the
search phase of foraging. By listening passively, dolphins may obtain useful information
regarding the identity, number, size and location of soniferous prey. Berens-Mccabe et al.,
(2010), indicated that at the population level, resident bottlenose dolphins of Sarasota Bay also
preferred soniferous fish prey.
Determining prey selection in wild dolphins is a relevant and important step in
understanding their role as predators in the ecosystem. The aim of this work was to analyze the
feeding habits and quantify the relative importance of prey species eaten by wild resident
Franciscana dolphins off the Uruguayan coast by evaluating stomach contents of dolphins
entangled in artisanal fishing nets or stranded on the beach.
Methods
Stomach contents analysis
A total of 41 Franciscana dolphins ( 24 females and 17 males) stomachs were analyzed. All died
as a result of becoming incidentally entangled in artisanal fishing nets or stranded on the beach
off the Uruguayan coast during 2013 and 2016 (Figure 1, Table 1). They were kept in freezers at

- 20°C until necropsy was performed. Each dolphin specimen’s total length (FTL) (cm) was
recorded according to Norris (1961) and intact stomachs were carefully removed and examined.
Food items were identified to the lowest possible taxon using laboratory catalogs. The total
numbers of empty stomachs were also recorded. Total length for all prey (PTL) species were
measured and total mass (g) of each species identified was estimate using length – weight


relationships previously described (Ehrhardt et al., 1977; Haimovici 1982; Bugoni & Vooren
2 004; Rodriguez & Gasalla 2008; Segura et al., 2012). (Place Figure 1 here)
