# Getting things set up

To create your first Obsidian Plugin, you need to have:

- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/) installed
- A Code Editor of your choice installed (My personal recommendation would be: [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/))

If you want to publish your Plugin someday, you also need the following:

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/), a Version Control System
- A [GitHub Account](https://github.com/signup)

You will be using Git to version your Plugin and also to push and pull changes from the remote Repository, which is basically just a “Folder in the Cloud”. In the End, I will tell you more about how to publish the Plugin, so that other people can install it from inside Obsidian.

The next step would be to clone the [official Sample Plugin](https://github.com/obsidianmd/obsidian-sample-plugin) from GitHub.

## With Git and GitHub

If you have a GitHub Account, just click the “Use this Template” Button and follow the Instructions:

Once you have your own Repository set up, just copy the following URL:

Afterwards, you can clone the Repository locally using the following shell command. Just make sure you are in the correct Directory you want your Plugin to live in.

Now you can finally open the Folder with your Code Editor.
