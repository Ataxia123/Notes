# Background

In his highly influential 18th-century work An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of The Wealth of Nations, Scottish economist Adam Smith first proposed the idea that as soon as a division of labour appeared in human society, such as some specialising in hunting while others specialised in crafting, people would naturally begin to barter with each other, leading to the double coincidence of wants problem that would give birth to money. Long prior to Adam Smith, Aristotle had also theorised in his book Politics in the 4th century BCE that barter preceded the inventionof money. Carl Menger, Stanley Jevons, and other 19th-century economists all kept Smith’s framework of barter preceding money. 

These days, every introduction to economics seems to speculate that barter was the foundation of “simple, early economies.” One trending title on the history of money charts its history from barter to banknotes to bitcoin. Meanwhile, in the world of science, anthropologists were out in the field directly observing how economies without money actually worked. They noted a vast diversity in arrangements, from societies where people competed to give the best gifts to societies that commonly held stockpiles of goods. As British anthropologist Caroline Humphrey concluded, “No example of a barter economy, pure and simple, has ever been described, let alone the emergence from it of money; all available ethnography suggests that there never has been such a thing.” Of course, barter has existed historically and contemporarily, but it has never been the basis of a whole economy and it was not the origin of money. 

Barter as a practice arises in three main circumstances: the first is in situations where people are used to using money but don’t have it anymore, such as in economic crises. In such cases, barter arises after the invention of money. The second occurs on rare occasions between strangers who will never see each other again, hardly the basis of a day-to-day economy. The third is where there are ongoing trade relations between strangers in moneyless economies, but no double coincidence of wants problem arises because they already know exactly what they want to acquire from the other party. If you’re going to cross a desert, a mountain, and an ocean risking death to trade your goods, you’re doing so because you know they have what you want and you have what they want. Even when money and markets did exist, they would still trade based on conventional rates of exchange, or if money was used, it was used for specific commodities. Being a merchant in ancient times was not easy, so you make it a bit easier by minimising uncertainty.

While it’s possible for such a system to generate a means of accounting, there’s no reason to assume that it would produce a concrete medium of exchange regularly used in everyday transactions within a society. Such a system would likely only be used by the tiny proportion of the population engaged in long-distance trade. As the late British anthropologist David Graeber argues, among the many flaws of this economic theory on the origin of money via barter is the assumption of spot transactions as the basis of early economies: if people don’t make the trade right away, there’s no deal. But why would we limit ourselves to spot transactions in a day-to-day economy? If you don’t have what I want right now, I can still give you what you want, and you’ll eventually return the favour. We are neighbours, after all. The vast majority of all economic relations in human history have existed between people that lived near each other and knew each other personally, not long-distance traders. An institution as impersonal as money wouldn’t cut it in such contexts.
