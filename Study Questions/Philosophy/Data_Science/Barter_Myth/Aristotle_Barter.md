Aristotle, one of the most influential philosophers in history, also theorized about the necessity and existence of the barter system before monetary economies evolved. In his works, "The Politics" and "Nichomachean Ethics," Aristotle postulated that the primitive society was structured around a simple bartering system of goods and services. He believed that barter naturally arose from the self-sufficiency of individuals and their needs that evolved beyond their abilities.

In Aristotle's view, the barter system was a precursor to the monetary system. He believed that money was invented as a response to the complications arising from the 'double coincidence of wants,' a phenomenon where a person has to desire precisely what the other individual offers. Aristotle's main argument was that a currency-based monetary system was a practical innovation to circumvent the limitations of barter trade.

However, this narrative of a transition from barter to monetary system provided by Aristotle has been criticized on various grounds. The critical flaw in his theory is the lack of empirical evidence. Anthropological studies suggest that 'pure' barter systems, where goods are exchanged for other goods without a standardized medium of exchange (like money), were rarely, if ever, observed in human societies. 

Most pre-monetary societies appeared to operate on a system of gifts and reciprocity rather than direct exchange as explained by Aristotle. Additionally, some scholars argue that Aristotle's theory may fail to acknowledge the realities of social relationships, interdependence, and informal modes of exchange in traditional societies, often based more on communal living and cooperation than on individualistic exchange.

Moreover, Aristotle insinuates a mechanistic progression from barter to money-system, which might oversimplify the complex evolution of economic systems. Such economic transitions likely varied greatly across different cultures and historical contexts, and were influenced by an array of socio-political factors.

Thus, while Aristotle's theories provide a foundational perspective on economic systems, they should be considered within historical, cultural, and empirical limitations.
