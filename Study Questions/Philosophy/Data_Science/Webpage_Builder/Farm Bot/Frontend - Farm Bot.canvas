You may also want to add more customized details about your bot in the Hero and Features sections.\n\nThe website will have a dark grey color scheme to go with the farming game theme. The Navbar contains a link to the features section and a button to add the bot to Discord. The Hero section introduces the bot, and the Features section provides more details about what the bot does. Finally, the Footer contains a copyright statement.\n\nThe whole website is responsive, meaning it looks good on both desktop and mobile devices. It uses TailwindCSS, a utility-first CSS framework that allows for deep customization while maintaining a minimal style.","id":"88d5df317e06c1d0","x":5660,"y":1860,"width":500,"height":1212,"color":"6"},

The layout is simple and clear with information about your bot, steps to get started, and the bot commands. There's also a link to bring potential users directly to the Discord invitation for your bot. Please note, you'll need to replace \"YOUR_BOT_ID_HERE\" with your actual bot ID. \n\nRemember to add your bot's real invitation link - you can usually get this from the `OAuth2` section in your bot's Discord developer page. Let me know if you need anything else! If you want to add more styles, you can directly use Tailwind classes. Moreover, you can change color or font styles as per your design needs.","id":"949ff6cf24a3402e","x":6220,"y":1860,"width":500,"height":1220,"color":"6"},

The `.glass` class creates the \"frosted glass\" effect that is characteristic of the Glassmorphism design style. The placeholder for the image is a gray div with a `h-64` height and it can be replaced with an actual image. Lastly, the footer is pushed to the bottom using `flex-1` on the main content. This makes the main content take up as much space as possible, thereby pushing the footer to the bottom of the page. \n\nDo replace `<!-- CONTENT HERE -->` with the actual content you want to display. This could include how to get started with the bot, a list of bot commands, and so on.
