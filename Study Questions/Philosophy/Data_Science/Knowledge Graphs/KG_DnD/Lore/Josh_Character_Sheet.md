Josh carries a holy symbol, a gift from his mentor when he started his divine journey. It serves as a symbol of faith but also a focus for his clerical magic. The warm presence of Josh at their side brings comfort to Ulthan and the rest of the party, knowing they are under the protection of divine favor.

Remember, each player character has a role to fulfill and Josh's abilities greatly complement Ulthan's strengths. Together they forge ahead toward the cave entrance, prepared to face whatever lies within.
