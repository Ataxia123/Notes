Certainly, I'll analyze some fundamentals for HEX, pursuing a ratification such as an academic grading system using letters A-F, with "A" representing excellent, and "F" representing poor conditions. Please note that these grades represent a theoretical analysis based on available data and do not constitute investment advice.

1. **Liquidity: A**
   HEX has high liquidity with more than $3.6 million daily trading volume and is listed in major exchanges like Uniswap and Bitget. Moreover, the spreads on these exchanges are very less indicating effective trading conditions.

2. **Market Capitalization: B**
   HEX is currently ranked high among all cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. It's market cap exceeds $4 billion which is substantial but still relatively smaller compared to the giants such as Bitcoin or Ethereum.

3. **Community and User Base: B+**
   HEX has a reasonably robust community, as evident on their various social media platforms. This is an indication of user loyalty and engagement which is a positive sign.

4. **Adoption and Usages: B-**
   HEX portrays itself as a high-interest blockchain certificate of deposit and is intended to replace traditional bank savings accounts, thus its adoption might be somewhat more complicated because it's confronting established financial institutions directly.

5. **Developer Activity: A-**
   While specific metrics on developer activity for HEX are not readily accessible, it is noted that the team has been active with regular updates and improvements since its launch.

6. **Regulatory Compliance: C+**
   Like many cryptocurrencies, HEX operates in a largely undeveloped regulatory landscape. While it has not run afoul of regulators as of yet, its marketing as an interest-earning product might invite scrutiny.

7. **Tokenomics: B**
   HEX's tokenomics is quite unique, designed with an inflationary approach ensuring a reward for stakers. However, its design is also a source of criticism as it heavily rewards early adopters and the project founder.

Remember, each grade is given considering the relative performance among cryptocurrency space. Additionally, ongoing changes in these areas can impact these grades. This analysis should serve as a starting point for further in-depth research.
