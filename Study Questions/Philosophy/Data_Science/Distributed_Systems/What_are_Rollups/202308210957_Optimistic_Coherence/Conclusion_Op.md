## Conclusion

Optimistic rollups are a major part of efforts to scale Ethereum using layer 2 architecture. Optimistic rollups build on Ethereum's security and decentralization while offering cheaper fees and faster transactions. 

Alchemy supports two leading projects based on optimistic rollups, Arbitrum and Optimism. [Sign up for free today](https://www.alchemy.com/?a=39dca3d5aa) and see how you can scale your dApp with Ethereum-based optimistic rollups. 

Once considered a fringe idea, Ethereum—the world’s first smart contracts platform—has grown considerably over the years, and now hosts nearly 3,000 decentralized applications (dApps), 4,000+ smart contracts, and over 90,000 transactions daily. 

But the increased activity on Ethereum has come with a cost: scalability.

Limits on block sizes and block times, although necessary for decentralization and security, reduce Ethereum’s capacity to scale and accept more users. The end result is a collection of problems most Ethereum users are familiar with—namely, high gas fees and slow transactions. 

[Scaling Ethereum](https://www.alchemy.com/overviews/ethereum-scaling-solutions) _safely_ requires increasing its ability to scale network throughput and latency without introducing trust assumptions. This is what several scaling solutions such as [Layer 2 rollups and sidechains](https://www.alchemy.com/overviews/sidechains-vs-layer2s) attempt to do. 

This article explores Optimistic Rollups (ORUs), a class of L2 rollup solutions designed to make using Ethereum cheaper and faster.
