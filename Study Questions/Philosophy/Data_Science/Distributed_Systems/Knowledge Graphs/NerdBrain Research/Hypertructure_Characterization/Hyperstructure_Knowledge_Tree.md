Hypestructure_Knowledge_Tree

Sure, here's a knowledge tree based on the notes from [[Hyperstructures]]:

1. Hyperstructures
   - Definition: Crypto protocols that can run for free and forever, without maintenance, interruption or intermediaries.
   - Characteristics
     - Unstoppable: The protocol cannot be stopped by anyone. It runs for as long as the underlying blockchain exists.
     - Free: There is a 0% protocol wide fee and runs exactly at gas cost.
     - Valuable: Accrues value which is accessible and exitable by the owners.
     - Expansive: There are built-in incentives for participants in the protocol.
     - Permissionless: Universally accessible and censorship resistant. Builders and users cannot be deplatformed.
     - Positive sum: It creates a win-win environment for participants to utilize the same infrastructure.
     - Credibly neutral: The protocol is user-agnostic.
   - Building a Hyperstructure
     - Hyperstructures are made to power millions of users and transactions.
     - They are built on top of existing blockchain technology.
     - They are designed to be scalable and efficient.
   - Applications of Hyperstructures
     - They can be used to create decentralized applications (dApps).
     - They can be used to build decentralized financial systems (DeFi).
     - They can be used to create decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs).
   - Challenges and Limitations
     - Ensuring security and privacy in a decentralized environment.
     - Overcoming scalability issues.
     - Ensuring user-friendly interfaces and experiences.
   - Future of Hyperstructures
     - Potential to revolutionize various sectors including finance, governance, and education.
     - Role in the development of Web 3.0.
     - Contribution towards a more equitable and decentralized digital economy.
