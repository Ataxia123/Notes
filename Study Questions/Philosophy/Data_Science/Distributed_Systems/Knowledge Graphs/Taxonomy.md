>[!cue] Taxonomy Definition:
>Taxonomy is the practice and science of categorization or classification. It involves organizing things into groups or types based on their characteristics. In biology, taxonomy is used to describe, identify, and classify organisms. Taxonomies can also be used in various disciplines such as business, economics, computing, education, safety, and research publishing. They can help in organizing information, improving search relevance, and facilitating communication. Taxonomies can be represented as hierarchical structures or networks, and they can be used to establish relationships between different categories. Overall, taxonomy plays a crucial role in organizing and understanding the world around us.

>[!cue] Evolutionary Taxonomy
>Evolutionary taxonomy, also known as evolutionary systematics or Darwinian classification, is a branch of biological classification that aims to classify organisms based on their evolutionary relationships. It combines phylogenetic relationships, progenitor-descendant relationships, and the degree of evolutionary change to classify organisms. **Unlike traditional Linnaean taxonomy, which produces orderly lists, evolutionary taxonomy builds evolutionary trees. It allows for the inclusion of whole taxa and recognizes that groups can give rise to new groups.** The concept of evolutionary taxonomy emerged before Charles Darwin's book "On the Origin of Species" was published, and it gained popularity with the modern evolutionary synthesis in the 1940s. This approach differs from phylogenetic systematics in its use of the term "monophyletic." Evolutionary taxonomy considers a group monophyletic if it is derived from a single common ancestor, while phylogenetic nomenclature requires that all descendants of the ancestor be included in the group.
