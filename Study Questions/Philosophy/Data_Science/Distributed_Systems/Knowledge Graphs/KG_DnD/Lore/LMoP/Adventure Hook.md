### Adventure Hook

You can let players invent their own reasons for visiting Phandalin, or you can use the following adventure hook. The backgrounds and secondary goals on the character sheets also provide characters with motivations for visiting Phandalin.

#### Meet Me in Phandalin

The characters are in the city of Neverwinter when their dwarf patron and friend, **Gundren Rockseeker**, hires them to escort a wagon to Phandalin. Gundren has gone ahead with a warrior, **Sildar Hallwinter**, to attend to business in the town while the characters follow with the supplies. The characters will be paid 10 gp each by the owner of Barthen's Provisions in Phandalin when they deliver the wagon safely to that trading post.
