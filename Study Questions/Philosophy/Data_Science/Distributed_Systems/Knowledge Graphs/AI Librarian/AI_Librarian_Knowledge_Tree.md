In order to answer this question, let's create a knowledge tree that would focus on the following areas:

1. [[Definitions_AI_Librarian]]

2. Intersection of Autonomous Agents and Librarianship:
    - Review studies and articles where autonomous agents are used in the librarianship field. 
    - Explore the tasks that an autonomous agent can and cannot fulfil in comparison to a human librarian.

3. Case Studies:
    - Look for real-world examples where autonomous agents have been used as a librarian or in similar roles.
    - Analyze these cases for success factors, limitations and learnings.

4. Technologies Involved:
    - Understand the technologies crucial for an autonomous agent to function as a librarian; this could include natural language processing, information retrieval, artificial intelligence.

5. Possible Challenges and Limitations:
    - Delve into potential challenges and limitations that might occur while using autonomous agents as librarians. 

6. Ethical Considerations and Implications:
    - Investigate the ethical aspects of using an autonomous agent as a librarian, such as data privacy, intellectual property, human interaction, and unemployment issues.

7. Future Predictions:
    - Based on the information gathered, make predictions about the viability and future use of autonomous agents as librarians.

Research papers, articles, and resources that could be helpful in this context:

- Huang, Qunying., & Thill, Jean-Claude. (2022). "Spatial Agent-Based Models: Principles, Concepts, and Applications." Cambridge Scholars Publishing. (This book provides an overview of autonomous agents and their applications)

- Svenonius, E. (2000). "The Intellectual Foundation of Information Organization." The MIT press. (This work can provide insights into a librarianâ€™s duties and understanding of information organization) 

- Dignum, Virginia. (2018). "Responsible Artificial Intelligence: How to Develop and Use AI in a Responsible Way." Springer Nature. (This work explores the ethical aspects of using AI)

Remember, this knowledge tree represents an ideal research route. Depending on the actual available sources, some branches may need to be adjusted.
