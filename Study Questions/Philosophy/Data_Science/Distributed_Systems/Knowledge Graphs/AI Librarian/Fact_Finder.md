**Objective:** The objective of the Fact Finder game is to promote research skills and broaden participants' knowledge on various topics. This game challenges participants to find the most intriguing or unique facts about a certain subject.

**Rules:**

1. **Identifying the Topic:** The game organizer will provide a topic for the round of fact finding. The topic can be anything from a historical event, scientific concept, to a prominent personality. 

2. **Research Time:** After the topic is given, participants will have a set amount of time (as defined by the game organizer) to research and find their unique facts. This could range from a few minutes for a quick game, to a few days for a more in-depth research project.

3. **Unique Facts:** The goal is to find a fact that is unique, i.e., no other participant has found the same fact. Each fact should be supported with the source reference to encourage good research practices.

4. **Presenting the Facts:** After the research time has ended, each participant presents their fact to the group. They must also mention their source, to ensure that the fact is credible.

5. **Fact Verification:** If there are disputes over the validity of a fact, the group (or game organizer) will do a quick verification using reliable sources.

6. **Scoring:** Scoring can be done in different ways. It can be based on uniqueness, presentation, or the relevance and intrigue of the fact. The scoring rules can be defined by the organizer.

7. **Winner:** The participant with the highest score at the end of a round or multiple rounds is considered the winner.
