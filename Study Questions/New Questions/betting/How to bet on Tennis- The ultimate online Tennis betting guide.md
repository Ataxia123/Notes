## US Open 2022: The Preview  

Twelve months ago, British teenager Emma Raducanu mocked the US Open odds to clinch her maiden Grand Slam title. Meanwhile, Daniil Medvedev defeated Novak Djokovic in the men’s singles final.

[![Action Network](https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/01/Screen-Shot-2023-01-24-at-9.59.54-AM-1.png?w=157)](https://action.onelink.me/qhpb/9b608af8)

Get the [free Action Network app](https://action.onelink.me/qhpb/9b608af8) for expert picks, live odds, bet tracking and more.

Both reigning champions will return to defend their crown this year. But with Iga Swiatek heavily favored to claim the women’s title and Rafael Nadal looking to add to his illustrious list of Grand Slam titles, Raducanu and Medvedev won’t have it all their own way in New York.

Defending champion Daniil Medvedev (+250) is the sportsbook’s favorite, mainly due to the fact there will be no Novak Djokovic this year. The world’s No. 1 was refused entry due to vaccination status, and this will open up the field massively. However, let’s not forget that Medvedev secured a straight-sets victory over Djokovic in last year’s final, picking up his maiden Grand Slam title in the process. We can’t write him off yet.

In the ladies tournament, Iga Swiatek (+200) looks destined to claim the women’s singles title in New York. She may be just 21, but the Polish starlet already has two Grand Slams to her name. There is stiff competition, however, and no woman has won Wimbledon and the US Open in the same year since Serena Williams achieved that feat in 2012.

## **The most popular Tennis bets**

### **The Moneyline**  

The most simple bet in sports, the most popular and easy way to bet on tennis, is by betting the moneyline. This essentially is just betting on which player you think will win the match. 

An example can be seen as follows: 

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
|**Player**|**Moneyline Odds**|**$100 bet returns…**|
|Rafael Nadal|+120|$220|
|Novak Djokovic|-200|$150|

Rafael Nadal is playing Novak Djokovic at the US Open. Nadal is +120 on the moneyline, and Djokovic is -200. This means a $100 wager on Nadal would return $220 ($120 profit + $100 stake). If you fancied Djokovic to win, you would need to wager $200 to win $100 profit. Your bet is a winner if the player you’ve backed has won the match. 

### **Set Winner**  

Set winner betting follows the same format as moneyline betting, and only you are betting on the outcome of a single set. Given the tennis format, you can bet on who the winner of the first, next, or last set would be. 

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Player**|**First Set winner**|
|Rafael Nadal|+100|
|Novak Djokovic|-110|

Often the odds are a lot shorter than the moneyline odds, but you are able to find some great value on the underdogs. 

### **Totals (Over/Under) Betting**  

Total betting can mean a couple of different things in tennis. This could be a wager on the number of games played in a match or on the number of sets.

For example, If Jack Draper and Nick Kyrgios are playing a 3-set match, the Over/Under may be set at 22.5 games. If you think the match will be close and bet the over, you need the match to last for at least 23 games. 

If Kyrgios wins 7-6, 6-4, that would mean the match consisted of 23 total games and you won your bet. Conversely, if the match ends 6-3, 7-6, or any other score less than 22 games, you’d lose the wager because the match only went 22 games.

Instead of betting on the total number of games, the total number of sets may also be available as a market. In the Grand Slams, this is a notably more favored bet, as the matches are a best of five sets for the men instead of a best of three. 

Using the Draper vs. Kyrgios example, but this time happening at the US Open. The Total line for sets could be set at 3.5, and if you think the match will once more be close and last longer, you’d back the over. In this case, you’d need four or more sets in the match to happen, needing both players to win a set for this outcome to happen. 

### **Correct score betting**

A market of potential value is wagering on the correct score of the match. For men’s tournaments in Grand Slams, the matches are a best of five sets, meaning it is a first to three sets. There are three possible outcomes for set scores to either player, 3-0, 3-1, 3-2 

In the ladies competition, it is a best of three, making the bettor’s life a little easier as there are fewer potential outcomes of scores, 2-0 or 2-1. 

A market for correct score betting would look like this: 

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
||**Emma Raducanu**|**Sloane Stephens**|
|2-0|+175|+225|
|2-1|+300|+375|

Of course, predicting the outcome is difficult, but if you find a heavy favorite in tennis, it is often worth backing that player to win 2-0, or 3-0, as the odds will be better than backing the moneyline. 

### **Tennis Live Betting**  

Tennis is one of the most popular live betting markets in the world. Odds can change after every point so you have to be ready to pull the trigger before it’s too late. You can also bet on who will win the next upcoming game.

With all of the potential swings, it’s a great sport to trade, but only for the most experienced bettors.

If Roger Federer is down 4-0 in the fifth set at Wimbledon, you can bet him +800 live. Then, if he comes back to even the match at four games apiece, you can then take his opponent at plus-money, locking in a guaranteed profit.

### **Tennis Futures Markets**

Futures markets for tennis are exactly the same as they are for other sports. Wagers are placed ahead of tournaments, with often longer odds for the tournament’s overall winner. 

Got a favorite player? Or think you know the next rising star? You are able to bet on these players to win tournaments and the Grand Slams months in advance. 

A futures market for Wimbledon would look something like this:

|   |   |
|---|---|
|**Player**|**Odds to win Wimbledon 2023**|
|Novak Djokovic|+200|
|Matteo Berrettini|+700|
|Rafael Nadal|+800|
|Daniil Medvedev|+800|
|Carlos Alcaraz|+900|
|Alexander Zverev|+1000|

It’s important to keep up to date with injury news, form, and any other tennis updates, to make sure your futures bets have the best chance of winning.

## **Upcoming Tennis Tournaments**

## How to watch Tennis in the USA  

In order to make sure you’re completely covered for every tennis tournament, you’ll need ESPN, the Tennis Channel, and NBC to watch every tennis game live. 

Grand Slam events and regular ATP/WTP tennis is spread out across these broadcasters, with most events on ESPN and the Tennis Channel. NBC offers coverage of a few key tournaments, including the French Open.

However, many sports betting sites and apps are offering live streaming of tennis tournaments, so it’s worth checking out which sites and apps offer this exciting feature.

## **Tennis Betting Strategies**  

[![Roger Federer](https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/08/Roger-Federer-2.jpg?w=1024)](https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/08/Roger-Federer-2.jpg)

### **Check the surface**  

Tennis can be played on three surfaces: hard, grass, and clay. Each player is suited to a different surface and comes into their own depending on the tournament. 

Players with big serves will enjoy playing on grass, as the ball plays a lot quicker, giving their opponents less time to react to return the serve. Clay courts see longer points, meaning players with better groundstrokes and those that have grown up playing in countries with clay courts are often more successful. 

Take Rafael Nadal for example; he has become one of the best tennis players of all time and has won 22 Grand Slams. However, 14 of these have come at Roland Garros, which is a clay court tournament. Roger Federer on the other hand, has 20 grand slams but just one Roland Garros win, showing he is more suited to grass and hard courts. 

These trends can help a lot, as underdogs who prefer the surface over their higher ranked opponent are often more capable of pulling off an upset. 

### **Live Betting is your friend**  

Tennis is tailor-made for live betting thanks to regular breaks in play.

This means sportsbooks have the chance to update the odds for a variety of markets after each and every point. They can also price up a range of different markets for each point, such as next point winner, next serve to be an ace etc.

Part of what makes tennis betting so popular is how much momentum can ebb and flow in a match and live betting on tennis reflects this.

If the favourite suffers a break of serve or two, or loses the first set to the underdog the moneyline odds will shift to mirror this. Bettors can take advantage of more generous odds about the pre-match favourite or back the underdog who already has a foothold in the match.

Live betting odds can update after every point meaning there can be an opportunity for more advanced bettors to take multiple betting positions in a single game.  
  
For example if a big server like John Isner is down 15-40 on his serve, the odds about him winning the game will have drifted to an backable price.

You may judge it worth the risk of backing the tall right hander to win the game given his fearsome service.

### **Check the Weather** 

  
Taking the elements into account can be a valuable source of tennis betting angles as they’re one of the variables that fall outside of a player’s control.

Rain arguably has the most potential impact on matches. On grass it can lead to lengthy pauses in play with swings in the momentum of the match often seen when play eventually resumes. Betting in play can be a great way to capitalise on this.

On clay players can play on when the heavens open, providing the court doesn’t become heavy. The surface slows down as a result, negating advantages like a faster serve and making matches closer, more competitive affairs.

Heat can also be a huge factor in tournaments played in hotter climates. When eying up a match one player may be more physically drained after playing one or two five setters in afternoon matches, while their rival has won through quickly in evening contests.

Wind too can be well worth taking into account. Baseline grinders may be more likely to throw in unforced errors in gusty conditions, while first percentages are likely to plummet – making fault bets in ‘next serve result’ markets an appealing tactic.

## **Tennis Betting Do’s & Don’ts**  

### **Do’s**  

**Stay up to date with tennis news**: There’s ample media attention surrounding tennis, especially the Grand Slams. This means you’ll always be able to find out any news surrounding upcoming tournaments and matches that may affect your tennis bets. 

**Take advantage of underdog opportunities:** Whilst not easy to spot, there are plenty of upsets in the world of tennis. Keep a look out for underdog opportunities, and make sure you capitalize. 

**Parlay your bets:** Many tennis matches will often have heavy favorites, and parlaying your bets is a great way to return a bigger profit. You can combine legs to create one large bet at increased odds. Parlay betting is available at most of the best online sportsbooks and is a fantastic method of betting.

### **Don’ts  
**

**Bet with Emotion:** It’s easy to become a fan of a certain player, but don’t always back them just because they’re your favorite. They don’t always win, believe me. 

**Always back the favorite:** Tennis odds are very difficult to set. It is not uncommon to see favorites lose during Grand Slams and even the smaller tournaments. Check out the underdogs, and look for opportunities. 

**Get carried away with live betting:** Many of the best tennis betting sites will offer live betting on every point, and it’s easy to get sucked into backing the winner of every point during the game. Take your time, and pick your moments, or you’ll lose your bankroll very quickly.

### **  
Is it legal to bet on Tennis fights?**  

Yes, betting on tennis matches at licensed online sportsbooks is completely legal. Like other sports, there are no restrictions on placing real money bets on tennis, as long as online sports betting is legal in your state.

You can bet on tennis at many of the best online sportsbooks. Check out the best online sports betting sites to place your tennis bets with. 

### **What are the best Tennis bets?**  

The best tennis bets are different for each bettor. Many would consider simply backing the moneyline as the best, as these are the most simple and easy to understand. However, as upsets are regular in tennis, this may not be the best strategy in the long run. 

### **Are there Tennis prop bets?**  

Yes, there are tennis prop bets. Unlike moneyline betting, prop bets include how the fight will end (method of victory), which fighter will win which round and whether the bout will go the distance. Prop bets with tennis often have longer odds, meaning larger potential payouts.
