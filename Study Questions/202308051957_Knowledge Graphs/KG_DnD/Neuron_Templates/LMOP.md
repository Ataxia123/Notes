_For those who have not read my previous posts offering advice for the Lost Mines of Phandelver (linked below), I'm a DM who has led several groups through LMOP over the years. Since I feel like a ranger in a familiar wood when it comes to this adventure, I thought it would be fun to share some observations and ideas I've cooked up through multiple tellings of this tale. I hope you find them helpful..._

Your players have survived the goblin ambush on the Triboar Trail. They've navigated the perils of the Goblin Trail in a frantic search for Gundren Rockseeker. The Cragmaw Hideout awaits!

**Today's Topic:** The Cragmaw Hideout, Areas 1-4 (pg. 7-10 LMOP)

**Cave Mouth & Goblin Blind** (Areas 1-2, pg. 8 LMOP)**:** I treat the cave mouth and the goblin blind as a single area, since the outcome of what happens on the approach to the cave mouth directly impacts what the goblins do from their position at the blind.

As written:

- If the players make sufficient noise to attract the attention of the bored, inattentive goblins sentries posted behind the blind, the goblins take action.
    
- If the players proceed carefully through area 1, both the goblins and party will become aware of each other once the players cross the stream to enter the mouth of the cave.
    

Whether your garden variety goblin is smart enough to count to 3 on his fingers is debatable. But he's certainly intelligent enough to size up a threat and determine whether he's outnumbered or overmatched. As such, my goblins sentries stationed behind the blind are unlikely to relish the idea of going toe-to-toe with the adventurers unless they have numeric strength in their favor.

If the goblins are outnumbered and become aware of the players in area 1, they'll flee for the cave where there is safety in numbers (11 goblins and a bugbear), formidable defenses (4 wolves and a flood trap), and the darkness of the cave - where their Darkvision may or may not afford them an advantage.

If alerted to the players presence in area 1, the goblins won't bother with stealth. They'll hotfoot it to the cave, which means roll for initiative and the chase is on.

- One of the goblins will use the Dash action to get to the western passage (area 4, pg. 10) in an attempt to alert the occupants of the goblin den (area 6).
    
- The other goblin will use its Move action to reach the kennel (area 3) and its other action to release the first of the three wolves chained there. If allowed, this goblin will continue to release additional wolves in each subsequent round until all the wolves are freed.
    

If the goblins remain unaware of the players until they splash across the stream to enter the cave mouth, all parties become aware of each other at that point, and initiative is rolled. In this situation, cut off from the cave mouth, the goblins will to retreat into the thicket to the south.

- If the goblins are at the top of the initiative count, they'll use their attack action to send some arrows at the players with their shortbows, use their Move action to melt into the thicket to the south, and then end the turn by using their Nimble Escape ability to take the Hide action in the thicket.
    
- If the goblins are lower in the initiative order and forced into melee combat, they'll momentarily remain planted where the are, using their attack action to defend themselves with their shortswords, and then use their Nimble Escape to take the Disengage action, followed their Move action to flee into the thickets. Once in the thicket, the goblins will use the Dash action each new round (limited to 30 feet since the thicket is Difficult Terrain) to put as much distance between themselves and pursuers, ending each turn using their Nimble Escape ability to take the Hide action.
    

From there, the goblins will try to remain beyond the reach of melee combatants, while enjoying the benefit of half cover from the hedge against ranged attacks. Once they melt into the thicket, they'll continue their attempts to evade the players, moving and hiding from any pursuer until the party gives up and moves on.

_If you're wondering how or why the goblin sentries in areas 2 & 5 would be alert, as opposed to lazy, bored and inattentive (the way they're written by the game designers), have a look at my previous post_ [Lost Mines Of Phandelver: Tips For Running The Goblin Trail](https://www.reddit.com/r/DMAcademy/comments/efli0t/lost_mines_of_phandelver_tips_for_running_the/)_, where I write about what might happen if a goblin escaped the initial ambush on the Triboar Trail, which sets the events of LMOP in motion._

A survivor from the goblin ambush, returning to the Cragmaw Hideout with tidings of their failure on the Triboar Trail and news of pursuit along the goblin trail would have the Cragmaw Hideout on alert, changing the complexion of this part of the adventure significantly.

By making the area 2 goblins alert and likely to spot the players upon their arrival to area 1, the game has the potential to become fast-paced and fluid, as opposed to an area-by-area crawl. In other words, with alert goblins in area 2, areas 1-4 have the potential to become one big combat encounter.

Once combat concludes in the first half of the cave, not only are you half-way through the Cragmaw Hideout - you also have the other areas of the cave primed for what's to come next.

- Does Klarg come out to address the players from the bridge before unleashing a delicious surprise with the flood trap?
    
- Does Klarg send his wolf and the 5 goblins from areas 5, 7 & 8 down to capture or kill the players who were able to remain in place when the flood was unleashed, or follow up on players who were washed away to capture or kill them?
    
- You'll notice I left our Yeemik and his goblins from area 6. That's because Yeemik and Klarg hate each other, and I play them that way. But more on that in my next post - _LMOP: Dungeon Master's Guide To The Cragmaw Hideout - Part II_. Stay tuned.
