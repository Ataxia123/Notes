"Hyperstructures" is a concept introduced by Jacob, which refers to crypto protocols that can run indefinitely without maintenance, interruption, or intermediaries. These protocols, which run on blockchains, are unstoppable, free, valuable, expansive, permissionless, positive-sum, and credibly neutral. They are public goods that create a positive-sum ecosystem for any participants. 

In the context of [[Letter from At0x]], the concept of Hyperstructures could be seen as a part of the technological singularity, where machines surpass human intelligence leading to a radical transformation of society. The unstoppable and permissionless nature of Hyperstructures aligns with the idea of a rapidly evolving technological landscape where traditional models of education and work are becoming obsolete. 

The author of "Letter from At0x" proposes a new model of education, "The New Academy", which leverages [[AI]] and digital technologies to create a more flexible, personalized, and learner-centered education experience. This aligns with the principles of Hyperstructures, asit also aims to be free, valuable, expansive, and permissionless. [[The New Academy]] could potentially operate as a Hyperstructure, running indefinitely without the need for traditional educational institutions or intermediaries. This would create a positive-sum ecosystem for learners, where they can freely access and contribute to the knowledge base. 

In essence, the concept of Hyperstructures in the "Letter from At0x" could be seen as a blueprint for a future where technology enables more equitable, accessible, and efficient systems - be it in education, work, or other aspects of society.
