hey everybody Peter Zion here coming to you from about 13 800 feet on where are my Square Top Mountain uh behind me you've got the Continental to divide with let's see if I get this right Sullivan Peak Santa Fe Peak Silver Peak Revenue peak in Decatur Peak project for another day anywho uh 

today we'll talk about media and why we're all so uninformed and what's why propaganda is doing so well uh propaganda only works when you do not have a well-informed population and for a population to be well informed you need multiple sources of information that are credible you know I'm sure that everyone has their own political view of course but we all have to agree on what the basic facts are and media has to work from that and that no longer exists in the United States 

the problem started back in the 1980s with the fax machine it used to be that every newspaper of size so basically like Des Moines Register on up uh had a number of rovering reporters several of which were stationed abroad and the not the larger papers and of course most the TP stations uh had fewer foreign bureaus and when you've got a system like that you have people who are capable of seeing what's going on right writing stories interpreting things you have copy editors who are doing checks there you have editors who are stationed abroad who are doing things and you get multiple eyes on every story before it comes back to the home printing or the home viewing and it goes through another round of fact checks and basically  detection 

well with the fax machine we no longer needed that degree of Staffing abroad things like copy editors went away and by the time we got to the 1990s we had email on attachments and with that we send down the numbers even more by the time we got to the 2000s most of those fewer foreign bureaus were gone and you just had a few roving reporters and as we got into cost of cutting Because the Internet Was Rising we got rid of most of those roving reporters as well and we just started using local stringers so people were getting local insights still but it was no longer getting fact checked it was being blinded by whatever the proclivities of the people who were collecting the information was and there was never a backstop 

well you fast forward today and we now have algorithms that are writing our newspaper stories for us and that are investigating and scraping the web for things and the fact checking has largely gone and in this sort of environment it is very very very very very easy for a charismatic politician to say you know that's not true at all that's just fake news what I say is real and you get entire political movements built around a person in that sort of environment news has a hard time playing  detector because the factfulness that is necessary for an educated populace to call itself is largely gone and people start putting their trust in a person rather than an institution or a set of information venues now where does that take us next still on Square top uh but this is now Mount Evans Mount berestad behind me a couple fourteeners uh where was I oh yeah now this sort of information desert if you will is not exactly a new experience just new to the United States in places like the Middle East where you've got call it charitably single party rule uh you basically have everyone living in an information vacuum and so the rumor mill becomes the news and 

that's one of the reasons why the American Experience in the Middle East over the last 20 years was so frustrating because it was so hard to convince people what basic truths were uh people would hear something from a rumor it would get spread via email and Twitter and that was the truth of the day in Russia you got something even worse because the rumor mill is augmented by state Monopoly on information and so basically if you get your information from Radio to TV you're drinking 100 Russian propaganda 

it's not nearly that bad here but it's not great with the higher Capital stretcher of the United States media is a business and it's all about who how many people you can get to watch your show so it's all about making sure people hear what they want to hear as opposed to what is true or what they might need to hear so uh Fox and um MSNBC of course are basically opinion programs now with very little news uh companies like um Newsmax are 100 opinion basically they'd be very very much at home in the Middle East and then of course Twitter has gone its own way that has gotten um let's just call it colorful if you're over 50 you might still be watching the Nightly News but as you notice it's like two-thirds drug commercials now if you are between 25 and 45 you're probably getting your news from Facebook which is probably the worst of them all and if you're under 25 you're probably getting from Tick Tock and all I can say about Tick Tock is at least it's better than Facebook so the question now is where do you get it from? 

oh so where can you get news from um I think that the most reliable international news source out there overall is now Al Jazeera they're heavily biased when it comes to All Things Middle East so I'd skip that six completely but they've got this idea that we're new to news and because of that we should like interview multiple people with multiple viewpoints and just present it to you you know we used to call that journalism uh France 24 is definitely in second place they are one of the few entities remaining that still have Global bureaus uh BBC is probably the one that has descended the most over the course of the last 20 years and Canadian broadcasting is definitely the bottom of the barrel 100 opinion 100 party line and nothing to be seen there uh beyond that you can always look to local news sources throughout the world uh they will be biased but it will give you a view that you don't get other numbers if you're looking for something a little closer to home there really only three national news entities that I think that are are kind of worthy of consideration um the first one is the Wall Street Journal but obviously they focus almost exclusively on financial news but what they do they're good at number two is Bloomberg not as good as it used to be but they do throw a pretty white net and their coverage is even-handed uh and then third there's something called straight arrow news which is a new project that is trying to bring contributors from across the political Spectrum to provide uh non-partisan views on everything from Finance to International stuff
