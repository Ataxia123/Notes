Research Summary:

1. Evidence from various anthropological studies indicates that barter, which is traditionally seen as a precursor to money, was not actually the foundational structure of pre-monetary societies.

2. Instead, these societies often operated on a system of social credits, where transactions were not immediately reciprocal but based on communal trust and long-term relationships.

3. This system worked well within small communities where everyone knew each other. However, as societies scaled and interactions between strangers became more common, the social credit system encountered trust issues.

4. As a solution to these trust and scaling issues, societies developed a medium of exchange - money. Money served as a standardized and widely accepted measure of value that eliminates the need for a direct barter system.
