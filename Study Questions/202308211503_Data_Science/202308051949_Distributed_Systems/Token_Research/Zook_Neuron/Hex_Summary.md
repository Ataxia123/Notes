HEX is an Ethereum-based decentralized finance (DeFi) project that offers high-interest savings via a process called "staking". Users lock their tokens in exchange for interest. The unique aspect of HEX comes from its "share" system that calculates individual interest payouts. The number of shares a user gets depends on the length and size of their stake, and the current share rate, incentivizing long-term holding. 

Critics of HEX associate it with pyramid schemes due to its high interest rates and aggressive marketing, but it continues to be popular with those looking for staking profits. 

Currently, the trading price of HEX sits at about $0.004195253341. The most active trading platforms for HEX are Uniswap V3 and Bitget. Moreover, HEX operates a referral program rewarding users who bring in new participants. Despite the controversy, due diligence is needed when investing in this project as with any other.
