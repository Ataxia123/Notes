Table 3.7: Comparison of Leading Lending Protocols
```
**Rank Protocol TVL ($B) Networks Monthly TVL Change (%) ***
1 Aave 5,11 8 - 12,26
2 JustLend 3,76 1 - 3,74
3 Compound Finance 1,83 2 - 9,53
4 Venus Protocol 0,802 1 - 7,22
5 Morpho 0,332 1 4,45
_*May 2023_

As Table 3.7 shows, the top competitors in the project's market include leading lending
protocols such as AAVE, with a total value locked (TVL) of $5.11 billion across eight chains;
JustLend, with a TVL of $3.76 billion on Tron; Compound, with a TVL of $1.83 billion across
two chains; Venus, with a TVL of $808 million on BSC; and Morpho, with a TVL of $332
million on ETH.

These competitors possess considerable strengths, including a long track record in DeFi,
extensive auditing to ensure the security of smart contracts and innovative approaches like
Morpho's combination of peer-to-peer lending with traditional DeFi lending. Furthermore,
they command a significant market share, contributing to their industry dominance.

However, these competitors also exhibit some weaknesses. Apart from AAVE, most major
lending protocols are limited to one or two chains, highlighting a need for cross-chain
lending. Additionally, their primary focus on experienced DeFi users may limit their appeal to
a broader, potentially less tech-savvy audience. These weaknesses could provide
opportunities for Earn to differentiate itself and carve out its own niche within the market.

## 3.3.2 COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE

_Score: 5/10_

The project offers several unique features that differentiate it from competitors. These
include a novel business case to provide liquidity for web2 business owners who also own
cryptocurrency, although this is not yet integrated into the MVP. Other standout features
include trading and borrowing against liquidity pool shares for increased yield and prioritising


multi-chain support. Furthermore, Earn offers the option to trade liquidity pair tokens as well
as perform KYC through soulbound NFTs. However, the project faces challenges in
protecting the intellectual property of these unique features, and there's a risk that existing
competitors could adapt them.

Despite these innovative features, the project does not have a first-mover advantage. First-
mover advantages can be critical in the nascent DeFi sector, as protocols that have
operated successfully for over two years are often viewed as more trustworthy. This lack of
first-mover advantage may be a potential obstacle to the project's competitiveness in the
DeFi industry.

## 3.3.3 MARKET OPPORTUNITY

_Score: 6/10_

Regarding market opportunity, Earn Network also targets real-life businesses in emerging
markets and web2 business owners who own cryptocurrency. The aim is to facilitate these
owners in taking out loans, although marketing to this segment may present challenges due
to the high need for educational efforts.
Emerging trends within the DeFi market could provide opportunities for Earn. However,
given the current negative market sentiment, it may be difficult to capitalise on these fully.
Nonetheless, competitive APYs and the wide availability of supported currencies could be
leveraged to attract users, demonstrating the potential for growth within the niche that Earn
is serving.

## 3.3.4 MARKET SHARE

_Score: 4/10_

The project is targeting the expansive DeFi market, which presently holds a total value
locked (TVL) of $47 billion. This market is dominated by prominent players like Lido's liquid
ETH staking protocol with a TVL of $12 billion, MakerDAO with a TVL of $7.2 billion, and
AAVE with a TVL of $5 billion. It's important to note that MakerDAO is categorised as a
Collateralized Debt Position Protocol rather than a lending platform.

Market forecasts project a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of around 45% until 2030,
with an anticipated TVL of more than $200 billion by that year. This substantial projected
growth signifies a vast potential market for the project. As for the project's current market


share, no specific data is available, making a direct comparison to competitors' market
shares not feasible.

## 3.3.5 PRODUCT DIFFERENTIATION

_Score: 7/10_

The project's unique features, such as its wide support of cryptocurrencies, multi-chain
capabilities, and liquid lending (where liquidity pool tokens can be traded and borrowed
against for greater yield), could potentially serve as central themes for marketing campaigns
targeting core DeFi users.
The project sets itself apart from competitors through several distinct features regarding
product differentiation. These include the planned Q3 feature allowing anyone to create a
lending pool, multi-chain support, and the ability to handle a wide range of cryptocurrencies.
Also, its unique take on liquid lending, trading of LP tokens and KYC option adds to the
distinctiveness of its service.

The combination of these features presents a unique value proposition to users, contributing
to the project's differentiation in a competitive DeFi market.
The project has outlined key marketing and advertising initiatives in its roadmap and pitch
deck. One key strategy is forming partnerships with real-life businesses in emerging
markets.

## 3.3.6 BARRIERS TO ENTRY

_Score: 5/10_

The project's primary revenue streams align with industry standards, leveraging its position
as an intermediary and planning for a token launch. However, it encounters several
significant barriers to entry that could affect its growth potential.

Firstly, attracting initial liquidity to match borrowers and lenders presents a challenge, as
initial deposits in unknown protocols can be difficult to secure.

Secondly, while low to medium technical barriers allow DeFi protocols to adopt existing
smart contracts, the development of new or innovative features necessitates substantial
coding, risk management, and auditing effort.


## 3.3.7 NETWORK EFFECTS

_Score: 7/1 0_

The project effectively leverages network effects to expand its user base and enhance its
value proposition. This is primarily achieved by tapping into different blockchain networks
and attracting various communities due to extensive cryptocurrency support.
Regarding this, it would be important to understand how the project's revenue streams, cost
structure, and pricing strategy contribute to its overall business model.

## 3.3.8 INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY & PARTNERSHIPS

_Score: 8/10_

The project has established partnerships with other Web3 projects, most notably with
MyCointainer. This connection is significant as core members from MyCointainer founded
Earn, allowing for several joint efforts that benefit both projects. This collaboration enables
mutual growth and strengthens their respective positions within the Web3 ecosystem.
However, no potential partnerships are disclosed that could further enhance the project's
standing.

## 3.3.9 MARKET SATURATION

_Score: 7/10_

The project operates in an environment that could be significantly affected by laws,
regulations, or policies, particularly as the DeFi industry continues to mature. New
regulations and legal frameworks introduced could potentially impact lending protocols,
affecting their operations in certain jurisdictions.

Despite DeFi's substantial growth, it remains a niche market. The P2P lending market,
including web2 companies, is significantly different from DeFi-based lending, and
penetrating this market segment would require considerable educational effort. This
saturation presents challenges for the project's growth potential, necessitating strategic
planning and innovative user education and engagement approaches.
