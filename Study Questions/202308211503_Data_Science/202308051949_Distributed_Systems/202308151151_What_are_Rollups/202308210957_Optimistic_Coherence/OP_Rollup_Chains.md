## What are the top optimistic rollup blockchains?

**The top optimistic rollup blockchains are Arbitrum, Optimism, Metis Andromeda, and Boba Network in terms of Total Value Locked (TVL).** Below is an overview of the different optimistic rollups (ORUs):

### 1. Arbitrum

[Arbitrum](https://www.alchemy.com/layer2/arbitrum/?a=39dca3d5aa) is an optimistic rollup project designed to improve Ethereum’s user costs and transaction speed by moving computation and data storage off-chain. The Arbitrum Virtual Machine (AVM) supports EVM-compatible smart contracts, allowing users to use favorite dApps for a fraction of Ethereum’s costs. 

### 2. Optimism

[Optimism](https://www.alchemy.com/layer2/optimism/?a=39dca3d5aa) is an EVM-compatible, optimistic rollup chain leveraging Ethereum’s security guarantees. Optimism uses an optimistic rollup (OR) construction to roll up thousands of off-chain transactions and save users on gas fees.

### 3. Metis Andromeda

Metis Andromeda is a scalable, low-cost, and functional L2 protocol based on optimistic rollups. Metis Andromeda’s unique stack can be applied to different use-cases, including dApps, DAOs, and DeFi.

### 4. Boba Network

Boba Network is an Ethereum L2 scaling throughput with optimistic rollup designs. Boba Network offers a Liquidity Provider (LP) service that allows users to withdraw funds immediately without waiting for a seven-day challenge period to elapse.
