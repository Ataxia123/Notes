With a circulating supply of 120 Million ETH, Ethereum is valued at a market cap of $219,912,779,143.

## What is Ethereum

Ethereum is a Proof-of-Stake [blockchain](https://www.coingecko.com/learn/what-is-a-blockchain) that powers decentralized applications ([dApps](https://www.coingecko.com/en/glossary/decentralized-applications-dapps)) through [smart contracts](https://www.coingecko.com/learn/crypto-smart-contracts), without being controlled by a centralized entity. As the first blockchain to feature smart contracts, it has the largest ecosystem of decentralized applications, ranging from [decentralized exchanges](https://www.coingecko.com/learn/top-defi-trends-to-watch-for-crypto-investors#3) to crypto [lending](https://www.coingecko.com/learn/what-are-crypto-loans-and-how-do-crypto-loans-work) and borrowing platforms and more. 

Ethereum is also home to numerous [Layer 2](https://www.coingecko.com/learn/what-are-layer-2-crypto-protocols) solutions that offer users a cheaper and faster way to process transactions on the blockchain. Some of these solutions include [Arbitrum](https://www.coingecko.com/learn/arbitrum-ecosystem-bridge-airdrop), which rolls up multiple transactions into a single transaction on Ethereum, and [Polygon](https://www.coingecko.com/learn/what-is-polygon-network-matic-an-ultimate-guide)’s Proof-of-Stake chain, which is a sidechain that runs parallel to the Ethereum blockchain. 

### What Makes Ethereum Unique?

Ethereum allows for the creation of [ERC-20](https://www.coingecko.com/learn/bep-2-vs-bep-20-vs-erc-20) tokens, which can be used as native tokens for the applications that live on the Ethereum blockchain. These tokens can be used for [governance](https://www.coingecko.com/learn/types-of-crypto#7) on their respective applications, for utility purposes such as paying trading fees, or as stores of value, as in the case of stablecoins like [USDT and USDC](https://www.coingecko.com/learn/fiat-backed-stablecoins-usdc-vs-usdt). However, gas fees for transactions are still paid in ETH, as transactions are still recorded on the Ethereum blockchain.

### History of Ethereum

The Ethereum project was initially conceived when Vitalik Buterin published the whitepaper in 2013. The yellowpaper, which consists of more technical details on how Ethereum would work, was later published by Gavin Wood in 2014. A fundraising sale was conducted in September 2014 and the network went live in July 2015. On 15 September 2022, Ethereum transitioned from Proof-of-Work to Proof-of-Stake consensus with the Merge. 

### What’s Next for Ethereum

Now that [the Merge](https://www.coingecko.com/learn/ethereum-upgrades-understanding-the-merge-and-ethereum-2) is over, the final stage of Ethereum 2.0 is sharding, where the database on the Ethereum blockchain is split into 64 shard chains. With sharding, each validator only needs to verify the respective shards they’re responsible for, instead of verifying the entire network. This will also lower the barrier to entry for anyone who wishes to run a node. Besides encouraging further decentralization, this will improve scalability and ideally reduce the [gas](https://www.coingecko.com/en/glossary/gas) fees on the Ethereum network.

### What can Ether (ETH) be Used For?

Ether (ETH) is the native [coin](https://www.coingecko.com/learn/crypto-coins-vs-tokens) that powers the Ethereum network and is used to pay for transactions. ETH functions as a utility token and is used to pay for gas fees for transactions on the Ethereum blockchain, denominated in gwei. Stakers on the Ethereum network earn ETH as their reward for securing the network. ETH is also a cryptocurrency, similar to bitcoin, and can be traded on multiple centralized and decentralized exchanges, or even deposited as collateral to take out loans.
