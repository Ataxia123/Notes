Onchain governance refers to the decentralized and granular process of governing Ethereum organizations entirely on the blockchain. In the case of the NONbeta Organization, governance is done by $SOON token holders who directly govern its finances and development. All structural changes and financial decisions are made through onchain voting, where $SOON holders stake tokens to support proposals. The Root Layer and Governance Layer are the two levels of governance. 

The Root Layer is governed by both the NONbeta development team and $SOON token holders. The team can make OS Update Proposals (OS-UP) to add new development features, upgrade the organization architecture, or fix bugs. To pass, OS-UP proposals must be supported by $SOON holders. A minimum quorum of 10% of the $SOON supply must be cast for a proposal to pass, and if 15% of the supply is cast in favor, the proposal ends immediately. The duration of voting and execution after the duration period is known as the "bomb" period.

The Governance Layer is exclusively governed by $SOON holders. Here, $SOON holders can vote on proposals determined at the Root Layer that govern the organization's finances and economics. The team has no governance powers at this layer. Governance proposals can be surveyless or survey-based. Surveyless proposals include altering the $SOON inflation rate, FoF Fee (token), FoF Fee (transaction), Covenants Routine Fee (transaction), Covenants Farming Fee (Transaction), Covenants Farming Fee (Burn), and Delegations Grant Insurance. 

Survey proposals include the Investment Fund Portfolio Routine Buy and Investment Fund Portfolio Routine Sell. Each proposal has its own quorum and max cap requirements, and token holders can vote within a specified duration. Quorum and max cap determine the minimum percentage of $SOON supply and the required support for a proposal to be validated or executed. 

Overall, onchain governance allows for decentralized decision-making and involvement of token holders in the financial and development aspects of the organization, ensuring transparency and autonomy in the decision-making process.
