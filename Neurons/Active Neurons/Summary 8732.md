The context primarily revolves around exploring the concept of the "Metaverse Manifesto" and the "Ethos of the Metaversal Bible." The Metaverse Manifesto lays out a vision and guiding principles for emerging digital technologies such as NFTs and Web3. It emphasizes that the narrative around these technologies should be shaped by a community-driven and decentralized approach, rather than a centralized authority.

The 'Ethos of the Metaversal Bible" is an initiative founded on the principles of "emergence" applied to intelligence engineering. It appreciates the idea that large-scale intelligent behavior can emerge from the cooperative actions of relatively simpler elements, citing examples from human markets to biological neural networks to ant colonies.

The context references the concept of a living book shaped by an NFT-holding community. Unlike traditionally static works authored by individuals, this decentralized work can be updated, refined, and interpreted by a collectively intelligent group. This approach aims to stay attuned to rapidly changing technology trends and a multitude of perspectives reflecting the inherently decentralized ethos of the technologies it discusses.

Lastly, the mention of Karl Friston likely refers to his work on the "Free Energy Principle," a theory about how our brains comprehend and interact with reality, which may have further implications for designing intelligent systems.
