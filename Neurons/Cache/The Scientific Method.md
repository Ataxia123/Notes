## The Scientific Method
A Proto Hyperstructure

The scientific method, a systematic technique used for investigation, can be viewed as an early form of a hyperstructure. This process has been relentlessly prompting researchers to make observations, form hypotheses, experiment, analyze, and draw conclusions, for centuries. It is a free, universally accessible protocol that persistently enhances our collective knowledge base. Moreover, it effectively encourages a positive-sum culture within the scientific community, fostering an environment of sharing and building upon established knowledge.

Just as a hyperstructure does, the scientific method accommodates endless expansion and strives for credible neutrality, minimizing bias by adhering to systematic, logical procedures. Overall, it serves as a global, decentralized framework for knowledge discovery and dissemination, making it a proto-hyperstructure.
