"Neurons as a new data structure" could mean leveraging the biological model of neurons in creating non-traditional data structures in computer science. These models could be capable of learning and adapting with information, like biological neurons.

- Biological neurons take multiple inputs, process them, and produce an output.
- Similar concept can be applied in a data structure where the structure can learn and adapt from the inputs it receives.
- This concept has been popularized in computer science with the advent of neural networks in machine learning, where the "neurons" in these networks improve their performances by learning from input data.
- Just like biological neurons can make new connections and strengthen existing ones, a neuron-based data structure could potentially form and strengthen connections between pieces of data.
  
Essentially, neurons as a new data structure could create systems that are more dynamic and adaptable, much like a biological nervous system. This would revolutionize how data can be sorted, stored, and understood.
