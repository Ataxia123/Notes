Hyperstructures have the following characteristics:

- Unstoppable: Once deployed, they continue to run as long as the underlying blockchain network exists.
- Free: They run at gas cost without any protocol-wide fees.
- Valuable: These structures accrue value which can be accessed and exited by the owners.
- Expansive: They include built-in incentives to encourage participation.
- Permissionless: Both builders and users can access the structure without the fear of being deplatformed, making them universally accessible and censorship-resistant.
- Positive Sum: They create an environment where all participants benefit, as they can utilize the same infrastructure, making it a win-win situation.
- Credibly Neutral: These protocols are user-agnostic, ensuring fair access and treatment without favouring any particular user or group of users.
