## MetaMask Integration Plugin for Obsidian

### Overview

This plugin will allow Obsidian users to connect their MetaMask wallets directly from the Obsidian application. It will help them to sign transactions, check balance, and do other Ethereuem related tasks without the need to leave Obsidian.

### Plugin Classes and Components

#### MetaMaskPluginSettings Interface

This interface will hold the user's settings for the plugin. Initially, it can be an empty interface as settings can be added later as required.

```typescript
interface MetaMaskPluginSettings {
}
```

#### MetaMaskPlugin class

This class will represent our MetaMask Plugin. It will be responsible for loading the settings, registering the ribbon icon, and establishing a connection with MetaMask.

```typescript
export default class MetaMaskPlugin extends Plugin {
	settings: MetaMaskPluginSettings;

	async onload() {
		await this.loadSettings();

		const ribbonIconEl = this.addRibbonIcon('wallet', 'MetaMask', (evt: MouseEvent) => { });
		ribbonIconEl.addClass('my-metamask-icon-class');
	
		this.addCommand({
			id: 'connect-to-metamask',
			name: 'Connect to MetaMask',
			callback: () => {
				/* code to connect to MetaMask */
			}
		});
	}

	async loadSettings() {
		this.settings = await this.loadData();
	}

	async saveSettings() {
		await this.saveData(this.settings);
	}
}
```

#### MetaMaskModal class

This class will create a modal dialog when the user clicks on the connect to MetaMask command. It will render a dialog with a button to trigger the connection to MetaMask.

```typescript
class MetaMaskModal extends Modal {
	constructor(app: App) {
		super(app);
	}

	onOpen() {
		const {contentEl} = this;
		let connectButton = contentEl.createEl('button');
		connectButton.setText('Connect to MetaMask');
		connectButton.onClick(async () => {
			/* code to connect to MetaMask */
		});
	}

	onClose() {
		const {contentEl} = this;
		contentEl.empty();
	}
}
```

### MetaMask Connection Code

The code to connect to MetaMask is not implemented in the above classes. They are remarked as `/* code to connect to MetaMask */` where they should be. 

The actual implementation will be dependent on the nature of the functionalities required and the rules enforced by the MetaMask SDK and its compatibility with Obsidian's framework & Electron.

Please note: This is a pseudo code for a MetaMask plugin in Obsidian. Metamask doesnâ€™t provide specific SDK for plugins or extensions, they usually use web3.js to interact with Metamask. Some specific features like linking Metamask with Obsidian might not be possible because of security and privacy reasons. Still, you can try to use web3.js with Obsidian, as both are JavaScript based. Please consider this before implementing.
