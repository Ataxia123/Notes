## Frontend

### Requirements:
1. A user interface that can interact with MetaMask SDK.
2. Design a new pane within Obsidian for displaying the plugin functionalities and for performing MetaMask actions (like sending transactions, connecting or disconnecting wallet, viewing account, etc.) 
3. Add a new button to the ribbon (Obsidian left sidebar) that opens up the pane.
4. Add proper notifications and error handling. 

### Architecture:
1. User Interface: ReactJS could be an ideal choice for building the plugin interface due to its flexibility, ease of use and performance. 
2. State Management: Implement state management using Redux or Context API to manage the globally used data.
3. Styling: Use CSS-in-JS libraries such as styled-components for styling the components.
4. Layout: Implement the plugin layout in accordance with the Obsidian UI for a consistent look and feel.
