### 4.1. Variational neuroethology applied: hierarchically mechanistic minds

The FEP is best known in neuroscience, where it has been used to explain the structure, function, and dynamics of the brain. In this context, the FEP concords with predictive coding by describing the brain as a hierarchical ‘inference machine’ that minimises prediction error by seeking to match incoming sensory inputs with top-down (neuronally-encoded) predictions [[26]](#br0260), [[34]](#br0340), [[40]](#br0400), [[68]](#br0680). This occurs in two ways: we can either improve our predictions by altering internal states (i.e., perception); or we can act upon the world to confirm our predictions (i.e., action). Thus, action and perception operate synergistically to optimise an organism's (Bayesian) model of the environment. As discussed, the FEP also transcends predictive coding by extending beyond the brain to explain behaviour, the phenotype, and all other biotic phenomena that span evolutionary timescales and spatially distributed ensembles. However, to understand the particular features of the human brain, the FEP requires recourse to research in psychology and the social sciences (e.g., evolutionary and cognitive anthropology), which target the specific ecobiopsychosocial processes responsible for the embodied models and behaviour of Homo sapiens in particular.

To address this need, an interdisciplinary EST of the embodied brain has recently been forwarded called the hierarchically mechanistic mind (HMM). Initially proposed to unify evolutionary and developmental psychology, the HMM is an evidence-based model of neurocognition and biobehaviour that synthesises the FEP with major paradigms in psychology to situate the brain within the broader evolutionary, developmental, and real-time processes that produce human behaviour, phenotypes, and niches [[7]](#br0070), [[70]](#br0700). Specifically, this model defines the human brain as an embodied, complex adaptive system that adaptively minimises the entropy of its internal (i.e., sensory and physiological) states through recursive interactions between hierarchically organized, functionally differentiated neural subsystems [[7]](#br0070). This hierarchy ranges from lower-order, highly segregated neurocognitive systems responsible for sensorimotor processing, through to the highly integrated association areas that underlie the sophisticated cognitive faculties unique to humans [[70]](#br0700). The HMM resonates with structural and functional imaging studies in network neuroscience, which show that the brain entails a multiscale hierarchical organisation characterised by the repeated encapsulation of smaller neural elements in larger ones ([[71]](#br0710), [[72]](#br0720); [Fig. 4](/pmc/articles/PMC5857288/figure/fg0040/), panel A). Predictive coding approaches suggest that this sort of architecture entails a hierarchical generative model that minimises prediction error via recurrent message-passing between cortical levels ([Fig. 4](/pmc/articles/PMC5857288/figure/fg0040/), panel B), affording a neurobiologically plausible, mechanistic theory of the functional integration of anatomically segregated neural networks [[72]](#br0720), [[73]](#br0730), [[74]](#br0740).
