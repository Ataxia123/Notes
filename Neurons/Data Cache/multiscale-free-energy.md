## 3. The big picture: a multiscale free energy formulation

The crux of our argument is that organisms can be described in terms of a (high dimensional) phase space induced by hierarchically nested Markov blankets. In other words, our ontology comprises populations of both spatially and temporally nested Markov blankets that occupy hierarchically nested regions in the total phase space of living systems. This sort of hierarchical organisation is a direct corollary of EST: since specific, functional (global) patterns of interacting (local) components need to be selected over competing alternatives to allow different levels of (informational, physical, chemical, biological, psychological, and sociocultural) organisation to emerge, the hierarchical nesting of Markov blankets instantiates Darwinian dynamics, which follows the same laws of statistical (or, strictly speaking, stochastic) thermodynamics, but in a nonequilibrium context that leads to self-organisation, self-assembly, and selective dynamics [[7]](#br0070), [[31]](#br0310), [[32]](#br0320), [[50]](#br0500).

### 3.1. Nested Markov blankets

To picture such hierarchical dynamics, it is useful to introduce the notion of a scale space. Scale spaces allow us to observe structures at different spatial scales. Imagine that you took a photograph, and then focused in progressively to examine smaller details. As you zoom in, you traverse a (spatial) scale space. The notion of a scale space is useful because the increase in scale, as we move from one hierarchical level of Markov blankets to the next, necessarily entails an increase in spatial scale. However, what were purposeful (i.e., free energy minimising) fluctuations at one scale now become fast random fluctuations at the next. This means that there is a concomitant increase in temporal scale as we ascend the spatial hierarchy. This composition of temporal and spatial scales is evident in the hierarchical organisation of the brain [[51]](#br0510), [[52]](#br0520), and more broadly, suggests that self-organisation should occupy a limited domain (along the diagonal) of a scale space with spatial and temporal dimensions [[18]](#br0180) (see [Fig. 2](/pmc/articles/PMC5857288/figure/fg0020/)). Note that the use of a scale space is purely for descriptive purposes. The underlying system in question does not change—just its level of description, the way it is measured, or the perspective taken on its hierarchical self-organisation.

Variational neuroethology. (**A**) The meta-theoretical ontology we propose, called ‘variational neuroethology’, uses the FEP to explain and predict how living systems instantiate adaptive free energy minimisation. We have indicated some scales at which free energy minimizing dynamics unfold. Since spatial and temporal scales are intrinsically correlated (i.e., events unfolding over long distances usually take more time to unfold), what we have is a scale space that is populated mostly along its diagonal [[55]](#br0550), [[56]](#br0560), [[57]](#br0570). (**B**) Equivalence classes of variational free energy minimizing systems. The free energy minimising dynamics at play are implemented by different kinds of mechanisms in different individual organisms and species, as a function of the coupling between their evolved phenotypes and biobehavioural patterns and the niches they inhabit and the scales under scrutiny. The gauge theoretical formalism for the FEP [[65]](#br0650) allows us to computationally model the regions of the biotic phase space, along its diagonal, that are apt to realize equivalent classes of dynamics. From [[65]](#br0650).

Recall from above that every ergodic system must possess an (ergodic) Markov blanket [[32]](#br0320). This simple observation delivers us to the core of our argument. Thus, we should be able to describe the universe in terms of Markov blankets of Markov blankets—and Markov blankets all the way up, and all the way down (see [Fig. 3](/pmc/articles/PMC5857288/figure/fg0030/) and Box 3). To unpack this, consider an ensemble of cells, each equipped with a Markov blanket that corresponds to the cell surface. Because the internal states of each cell are sequestered behind their respective Markov blankets, all interactions between cells must be mediated by their Markov blankets. This means that we can describe the self-organisation of the cellular ensemble purely in terms of transactions among the (sensory and active) states of Markov blankets. However, these exchanges will themselves have a sparsity structure that induces a Markov blanket of Markov blankets. For example, one subset of the ensemble could be an organ that is surrounded by epithelia that provide a Markov blanket for all of the cells that constitute the internal states of the organ. However, this still follows exactly the same (statistical) structure—an ensemble of Markov blankets. We can then repeat this process, at increasingly larger scales of self-organisation, to create a series of hierarchically nested systems (e.g., the body) [[42]](#br0420).

Nested Markov blankets. This schematic illustrates the hierarchical construction of (scale-free) compositions of Markov blankets of Markov blankets. The idea here is that particles, cells or subsystems at one scale (each comprising a Markov blanket b(i)j that enshrouds internal states μ(i)j) constitute an ensemble of states with a sparse dependency structure, which induces a Markov blanket at the supraordinate scale. This allows one to construct Markov blankets of Markov blankets by (i) partitioning the states at one level into a series of internal subsets and their Markov blankets and (ii) creating states for the next level by taking mixtures of Markov blanket states. Note that the internal states can be ignored when going from one level to the next because they are conditionally independent of external states (i.e., mixtures of Markov blankets from other subsystems). The mixtures can be regarded as slow (unstable) modes that are referred to as _order parameters_ in synergetics [[18]](#br0180). Filled (cyan) circles correspond to Markov blanket states at the i-th scale, where, as in [Fig. 1](/pmc/articles/PMC5857288/figure/fg0010/), red denote sensory states and blue active states. The pictures (of Broccoli) in the upper panels illustrate the self similarity of this recursive partitioning. (For interpretation of the references to colour in this figure, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.)

This sort of hierarchical structure provides a universal and recursive perspective to understand self-organisation across spatial and temporal scales, and to explain how each level contextualises (constrains) the levels both above and below. The hierarchal composition of Markov blankets within Markov blankets follows naturally from the existence of a Markov blanket that, in turn, is mandated by the existence of any system that can be distinguished from its external milieu. The key point here is that at every level, the same variational, surprise-reducing dynamics must be in play to supply Markov blankets for the level above. As we argue below, this idea offers a promising new research heuristic for the biological sciences.
