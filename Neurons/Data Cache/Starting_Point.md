Considering the context, it seems like you are asking for a new feature for the Baby AGI project where it works as a Vault Librarian. The following code could be a high-level Python implementation to get you started:

```python
class VaultLibrarian:
    def __init__(self, vault):
        self.vault = vault

    def store_document(self, document):
        title = document.title
        content = document.content
        self.vault.documents[title] = content

    def retrieve_document(self, title):
        if title not in self.vault.documents:
            return None
        
        return self.vault.documents[title]

    def search_document(self, keywords):
        results = []
        for title, content in self.vault.documents.items():
            if all(keyword in content for keyword in keywords):
                results.append((title, content))
        return results
```

In the code above, an instance of a VaultLibrarian has a vault that contains documents. The `store_document` method stores a document in the vault, `retrieve_document` retrieves a document from the vault by its title (returns `None` if it doesn't exist), and `search_document` searches the vault for all documents that contain specific keywords in its content.

Please note that this is a highly simplified example and might need further adjustments based on your exact needs. For example, you may want to integrate this with a more sophisticated search or database solution if you are dealing with a large number of documents, or if more complex search queries are needed.
