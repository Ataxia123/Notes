The scientific method can be considered an early form of a hyperstructure, due to its characteristics of being open, communal, and subject to continuous improvement.

- **Unstoppable:** The scientific method has been continually employed for centuries, across fields and disciplines, without interruption. 

- **Free:** Access to the scientific method itself and the knowledge produced by it are free, subject only to the requirement of understanding the methodology and the results.

- **Valuable:** Knowledge produced through the scientific method accrues value over time, contributing to the overall body of human understanding.

- **Expansive:** The scientific method creates incentives for participation (in the form of recognition and advancement of knowledge) and allows for indefinite expansion of subject area, hypotheses, and nuances within its framework.

- **Permissionless:** Anyone, regardless of status or location, can use the scientific method.

- **Positive Sum:** The scientific method encourages sharing and building on knowledge, leading to a win-win for all participants - individual researchers, the scientific community and society at large.

- **Credibly Neutral:** The scientific method is user-agnostic, relying on a systematic and logical approach to discover how things in the universe work. This helps to eliminate bias.

Thus, the scientific method can be seen as a blueprint for a hyperstructure tailored towards knowledge discovery, creation, and dissemination.
