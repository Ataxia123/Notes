#### Engineering Intelligence Through Emergence

Our world gives us countless examples of how complex, adaptive systems can emerge from the interaction of relatively simple components. These phenomena fall under the broad umbrella of emergence which describes how systems can display collective phenomena or behaviors that are not present in their individual components (David Pines).

Emergence allows systems made of simple elements to display high-order intelligence.

Markets are one example of an emergent phenomenon. As we pointed out previously, societal and technological progress outstripped biological evolution long ago. We are still the same tribal animals as our ancestors 40,000 years ago. Consequently, we have the same biological limit on how many people we can know well enough to cooperate effectively with - around 150 individuals. Yet all of the great works of human history and the high degree of specialization in our modern economy require substantially more than 150 people.

Markets make this possible and have been a primary driver of human progress over the last 10,000 years. Markets allow people from all over the globe to coordinate their actions without ever meeting one another. A tin supplier in China who manages to significantly increase his output of tin, makes tin marginally more attractive for consumers relative to other alternatives. His actions also make further tin production less attractive to other producers.

"The whole acts as one market, not because any of its members survey the whole field but because their limited individual fields of vision sufficiently overlap so that through many intermediaries the relevant information is communicated to all." Frederick Hayek.

Emergence can also be seen in the aggregation of individual transactions into blocks which are then linked sequentially to form a blockchain. Each transaction is relatively simple, involving the transfer of digital assets from one account to another. Each block is simply a record of all of the transactions that took place within a given time period. Yet when all of these transactions are aggregated into a blockchain they create a secure and immutable ledger of all past transactions, enabling new applications and innovations. A block is relatively simple, the blockchain is living economic history. A record of every transaction that has ever taken place on the network (The Network State).

Your ability to read these words is also a product of emergence. Our brains are the most fascinating and powerful biological computers in existence. Yet unlike computers, no one designed them. Somehow 100 billion networked neurons combine to create memory, intelligence and the experience of consciousness

Each neuron operates by relatively simple behavioral rules, firing an electrical signal in response to a certain threshold of input. They are not in and of themselves conscious. Yet the pattern of connections, the way in which your neurons fire and wire together, combine to create consciousness. Our intelligence is a property of the way in which our neurons are networked and interact with each other. It is an emergent pattern rather than a sum of its components.

Ant colonies are another excellent example of emergent behavior. Ants are some of the most successful animals on the planet. They owe their success to their ability to coordinate the actions of thousands of individuals to create adaptive and intelligent group behavior.

Ant colonies are able to determine the shortest path to a food source, build dedicated trash piles and cemeteries for the colony, allocate their workers among various jobs and adjust distribution of workers among these jobs in response to changes in the environment.

Ants are able to do this despite having brains the size of a pinhead. None of them have the intelligence to coordinate or direct the colony nor even understand their place in it. Instead ants coordinate their behavior according to simple rules and signals mediated by pheromones. For example, when an ant discovers a food source, it leaves a trail of pheromones behind it that other ants can follow to the food source. Similarly, when a threat is detected, ants will release an alarm pheromone that signals other ants to attack or flee (Emergence).
