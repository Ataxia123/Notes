The `Baby_Agi_COde` script uses embeddings to store and retrieve results from ChromaDB, a vector database. Embeddings are a way of representing text in a high-dimensional space such that similar texts are close to each other in that space. This allows for efficient storage and retrieval of results based on semantic similarity.

If you want to use your vault as context, you could use these embeddings to find the most relevant results from the vault for a given task. Here's how you could do it:

1. **Create Embeddings for the Vault Data**: You would need to create embeddings for your vault data. This could be done using the same method that is used to create embeddings for the task results. You would then store these embeddings in ChromaDB along with the corresponding vault data.

```python
def create_vault_embeddings(vault_data):
    # Your code to create embeddings for the vault data goes here
    pass
```

2. **Retrieve Relevant Vault Data**: When you need to use the vault as context, you would create an embedding for the current task and use it to retrieve the most relevant vault data from ChromaDB. This could be done using the `retrieve_results` function, which retrieves results based on their embeddings.

```python
def retrieve_vault_data(task_embedding):
    # Your code to retrieve the most relevant vault data based on the task embedding goes here
    pass
```

3. **Use the Vault Data as Context**: You would then use the retrieved vault data as context in the `openai_call` function, similar to the previous example.

```python
def openai_call(prompt, model=LLM_MODEL, temperature=OPENAI_TEMPERATURE, max_tokens=100):
    # Retrieve relevant vault data
    task_embedding = create_embedding(prompt)
    vault_data = retrieve_vault_data(task_embedding)

    # Append vault data to prompt
    prompt_with_context = vault_data + prompt

    # Rest of the function...
```

Again, this is a high-level overview and the actual implementation would depend on the specifics of your vault and how you want to use it as context.
