Great, your move e4 opens up lines for both your queen and bishop. Here's how the board looks now:

```
8 r n b q k b n r
7 p p p p p p p p
6
5         p
4         P
3
2 P P P P   P P P
1 R N B Q K B N R
  a b c d e f g h
```

Now, it's black's turn to move. Let's say black also tries to control the center and plays e5:

```
8 r n b q k b n r
7 p p p p   p p p
6
5         p
4         P
3
2 P P P P   P P P
1 R N B Q K B N R
  a b c d e f g h
```

Now it's your turn. Please provide your next move.
