product leadership background, having founded profitable staking platforms and collaborated
with prominent financial institutions. In addition, his experience with user experience and

experience in smart contract development and DeFi applications, having contributed to
numerous crypto trading platforms. He possesses expertise in several technologies crucial
for the project. However, Sinicki's experience is primarily technical, which may limit his ability

**Legor Gumeniuk (Full-Stack Developer)** – Legor Gumeniuk has extensive experience in
software engineering, designing and launching blockchain-based platforms. His proficiency
in various technologies is valuable, but lacking a LinkedIn profile may limit his ability to
