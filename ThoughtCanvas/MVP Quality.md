## 3.4 MVP QUALITY

## 3.4.1 FUNCTIONALITY

_Score: 7/10_

The MVP provides a platform for different investment strategies, liquid lending, and
borrowing. It offers a dashboard that provides an overview of loans, complete with interest
rates and risk ratios, though this interface currently appears cluttered.

The core features that address the target market's needs revolve around various lending
pools, a borrowing option, and an investment overview. These features address the
fundamental requirements of users interested in investing, borrowing, and pooling liquidity.

Regarding innovation, the MVP supports liquid lending, a feature that allows users to borrow
against any liquidity pool. Furthermore, liquidity pool tokens can be traded, and borrowers,
as well as lenders, can perform KYC, receiving soulbound NFTs as a confirmation. This
feature sets the MVP apart, although it should be noted that this is rapidly becoming a more
common feature amongst industry competitors.

Compared to existing solutions, the MVP provides basic functionality that aligns with industry
standards. However, some weaknesses have been identified in the user experience.

One significant limitation that may hinder user engagement and adoption is the absence of a
user-friendly flow when executing transactions. Most platforms prompt an overview screen
before asking the user to sign off on their investment or loan. However, this critical feature


seems to be missing in the current MVP, potentially leading to confusion or uncertainty for
users during transaction processes.

## 3.4.2 USER EXPERIENCE

_Score: 6/10_

While the MVP's usability might be comfortable for seasoned DeFi veterans who are familiar
with Save and similar lending protocols, it presents challenges for non-DeFi users.

This issue becomes particularly problematic because the pitch deck identifies low-tech users
as a primary customer group. A notable absence of tooltips to explain various terms used on
the platform and a lack of detailed descriptions of the risks associated with borrowing
exacerbates the issue. Furthermore, the MVP needs a confirmation page before providing
liquidity or borrowing, potentially leading to confusion and errors.

The MVP's design and user interface mostly align with the industry standard, although a few
minor design flaws have been observed. For instance, in the offer section, it seems that
there are three tabs which are not clickable. Additionally, some terminology is confusingly
labelled, such as the utilisation ratio in the offer section as the â€œMethod".

As for onboarding and support resources, the MVP offers some tooltips, but many
explanations are still needed. These ideally cover individual terms, the platform's general
workings, resources, tooltips, and information on topics like the pool owner.

The most significant friction in the user experience appears to be the absence of a
confirmation page. This absence creates a potential pain point that could discourage user
engagement and lead to mistakes when providing liquidity or borrowing processes.
Addressing these issues would significantly enhance the platform's usability, particularly for
its targeted low-tech users.

## 3.4.3 SCALABILITY

_Score: N/A_

Additional information is needed to assess the MVP's scalability and the underlying
infrastructure.


## 3.4.4 ROADMAP

_Score: 6/10_

The project's roadmap includes key milestones for 2023 but lacks detailed information on
planned improvements and specific partnerships. Although the roadmap demonstrates some
commitment to development and innovation, it could benefit from greater transparency,
accountability, and updates to enhance community engagement. Addressing these concerns
would help improve the project's overall value proposition and future outlook.

The project's roadmap for 2023 outlines three key milestones: the token launch in Q2,
enabling pool creation for everyone in Q3, and a CEX listing in Q4. However, onboarding
guides and UI improvements are notably absent from the roadmap, with the only related plan
being the integration of MPC wallets with mobile verification slated for Q4.

While the roadmap does not extend beyond 2023, the project's commitment to continued
development and innovation is signalled by its ambition to secure a token listing on a major
exchange by the year's end. Although the roadmap does mention potential partnerships, no
specific names or areas of collaboration are indicated.

The project team's transparency and accountability in communicating progress and updates
to the community could be improved. While the roadmap is updated with checkmarks
indicating completed tasks, links to these completed items and more precise action items
would be beneficial. For items past their due dates and incomplete, such as the MVP launch
and the launch of the first DeFi pool, additional commentary explaining why these tasks
remain uncompleted would provide more transparency and accountability to the community.

## 3.4.5 SECURITY

_Score: N/A_

Additional information is required to assess the MVP's security.

## 3.4.6 INTEROPERABILITY

_Score: 7/10_

The MVP showcases promising interoperability within the Web3 ecosystem. It indicates
scalability to other EVM-compatible chains, such as Polygon and BNB, enhancing its
integration capabilities with other Web3 projects and protocols. Furthermore, it supports


multiple chains, although information on cross-chain liquidity pooling or borrowing is
currently unavailable.

However, more information is required in the following areas to provide a comprehensive
understanding of the project's interoperability:

- Existing partnerships or collaborations with other projects in the Web3 ecosystem.
- Contributions to or leverage the broader Web3 ecosystem to enhance its value
    proposition or user experience.
- Documentation and accessibility of the project's APIs, SDKs, or other developer
    resources.

## 3.4.7 PRIVACY

_Score: N/A_

Additional information on compliance with GDPR and other data protection treaties is
needed.

## 3.4.8 FLEXIBILITY

_Score: 8.5/10_

The MVP demonstrates substantial flexibility, highly adaptable to changing market conditions
and user needs. Its support for a broad range of currencies, multi-chain approach, and ease
of adding new pools facilitates this adaptability.

However, the project's long-term balance between its goals and short-term flexibility is
mainly based on assumptions derived from the team's previous experience and provided
documents, indicating high adaptability.

To provide a more comprehensive understanding of the project's flexibility, additional
information is required in the following areas:

- The design of the project's underlying technology and architecture to support future
    changes and improvements.
- The project team's responsiveness to user feedback and requests for new features
    or improvements.
- Examples of the project pivoting or adapting to new challenges or opportunities.
