MerTK, fully known as c-mer proto-oncogene tyrosine kinase, is a protein that in humans is encoded by the [[MERTK gene]]. This receptor [[tyrosine kinase]] plays a vital role in regulating various cellular processes including cell survival, [[migration]], [[differentiation]], and phagocytosis of apoptotic cells ([[efferocytosis]]). Abnormalities in MerTK signaling are linked to a range of diseases, including [[cancer]] and [[retinitis pigmentosa]], a type of hereditary retinal degeneration. A better understanding of MerTK could potentially lead to targeted therapies for treating MerTK-associated diseases.

Here are five research questions that could potentially extend our understanding of the MerTK protein:

1. [[**What is the detailed molecular mechanism of MerTK signaling in normal cells?** ]]Understanding the normal signaling cascades could highlight the abnormalities seen in disease conditions.
   
2. [[**How is MerTK expression regulated at the gene and protein level?** ]]Answers to this question could provide insights into ways to modulate MerTK levels as a therapeutic strategy.
   
3. [[**What are the downstream effector proteins or pathways activated upon MerTK activation?**]] These could serve as additional targets for indirect modulation of MerTK activity.
   
4. [[**What is the impact of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the MERTK gene on the function of the protein and disease progression?** ]]This could aid in the identification of risk factors and lead to personalized treatment strategies.
   
5. [[**Can MerTK activity be effectively targeted for therapeutic purposes in MerTK-related diseases, and what are potential side effects of such strategies?**]] The safety and efficacy of potential therapies could be evaluated with this particular line of research.
