**Lecture Notes: Introduction to the Course and Blockchain Technology**

- <mark style="background: #FFB86CA6;">Welcome</mark> students and introduce the "Introduction to Blockchain and Cryptocurrencies" course.
- Provide an overview of the course objectives and explain the topics covered in the syllabus.
- Define blockchain technology and highlight its significance in the digital age.
- Discuss the key characteristics of blockchain, such as decentralization, immutability, and transparency.
- Explain the historical context of blockchain and its connection to the emergence of Bitcoin as the first blockchain-based cryptocurrency.

The lecture will focus on giving students a foundational understanding of the course's scope and the fundamental principles of blockchain technology. It will set the stage for further exploration of blockchain, cryptocurrencies, and their potential applications in various industries.

Class Questions:

***1. What is the purpose of this course, and what are your expectations from learning about blockchain and cryptocurrencies?***

***2. How would you define blockchain technology in your own words? What are some key aspects that make it unique compared to traditional systems?***

***3. Can you think of any real-world examples where the decentralized nature of blockchain might be advantageous?***

4. Reflect on the historical context of blockchain technology. How did the emergence of Bitcoin contribute to the development of the blockchain ecosystem?

5. What are some potential benefits of using blockchain in various industries, such as finance, supply chain, or healthcare?

6. Discuss the concept of "trustlessness" in the context of blockchain technology. How does it impact the way transactions and data are verified and recorded?

7. Cryptography plays a crucial role in securing blockchain data. Can you think of any other applications of cryptography in everyday life beyond blockchain?

8. How do consensus mechanisms like Proof of Work (PoW) and Proof of Stake (PoS) work, and what are the advantages and disadvantages of each approach?

9. In what situations might a decentralized consensus mechanism be preferable to a centralized one? What are some potential challenges in implementing decentralized consensus?

10. As we explore various use cases of blockchain technology, what are some ethical considerations that we should be mindful of?

By framing the lecture as a series of questions, students will be encouraged to think critically about the concepts presented and actively participate in discussions. This dialectics-based approach will promote a deeper understanding of blockchain technology and its implications, while fostering an engaging learning environment.
