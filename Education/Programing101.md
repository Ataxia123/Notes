Course Title: Introduction to Programming Languages

Course Description:
The "Introduction to Programming Languages" course is a comprehensive program designed to introduce students to the fundamentals of programming using four popular programming languages: JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, Rust, and Solidity. Through hands-on exercises, practical projects, and theoretical lessons, students will gain a solid foundation in programming concepts and syntax for each language, empowering them to embark on their journey as versatile programmers.

Course Objectives:
1. Introduce students to the core principles of programming.
2. Provide a practical understanding of JavaScript, TypeScript, Python, Rust, and Solidity.
3. Explore the unique features and use cases of each language.
4. Foster problem-solving skills through coding exercises and projects.

Suggested Course Duration: 10 weeks (20 sessions)

Assessment and Grading:
- Class participation and engagement.
- Regular coding exercises to reinforce learning.
- Practical projects in each language to demonstrate proficiency.
- Quizzes and tests to assess understanding of programming concepts.

Note: This syllabus can be adapted based on the prior programming knowledge of the students and their specific interests. Additional resources, code-along sessions, and guest speakers from the industry can enhance the learning experience and provide practical insights into real-world use cases of these programming languages.
