# 2022-07-23: Boolean Task Queries & Improved Sidebar Controls
Plugin settings design tips & productivity book recommendations.

## In The Community

-   The subreddit has [new flairs](https://www.reddit.com/r/ObsidianMD/comments/w4bpun/robsidianmd_mod_update_20220721/) for plugins and themes, and encourages people who want to post memes to use the new [meme subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/ObsidianMDMemes/).

## Tips

-   It's a good habit to restart Obsidian after you disable or update plugins and themes, just in case there's been dependency updates or issues with unloading old settings.

## Obsidian Updates

-   Silver and Licat, the duo who developed Obsidian solo before recently bringing Liam onto the team, just had a baby â€” their second together since launching Obsidian ðŸ¥°. They all got home from the hospital on Sunday and seem to be doing well.
-   [Insider 0.15.7](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/obsidian-release-v0-15-7-insider-build/40543) had a bunch of fixes and added support for `.mov` and `.mkv` files (although the precise support may vary by platform). You can also get the `Inter` font from the top of the font list now â€” it's the old default font. You can switch back to Inter by going to `Settings > Appearance` in Obsidian, which will make `->` turn back into a "proper arrow" if you're into that. But really you should consider a more font agnostic method, like those described [in Discord](https://discord.com/channels/686053708261228577/702656734631821413/998649374118785087).

## Plugin News

### New in Community Plugins

-   [Ninja Cursor](https://github.com/vrtmrz/ninja-cursor) by `@vrtmrz` Â enhances cursor visibility, [Commander](https://github.com/phibr0/obsidian-commander) by `@phibr0` Â lets you add more commands to your work space, and you can now more simply [trim unnecessary whitespace](https://github.com/zlovatt/obsidian-trim-whitespace). Here's a Discord demo of [Commander](https://discord.com/channels/686053708261228577/855181471643861002/999763489579077632)

### Pending (as of Friday morning)

_Note: Not all new plugins are available in the community list yet, as they need to go through code review first. You can manually install plugins that aren't in the community list yet by using the [Beta Reviewer's Auto-update Tool](https://github.com/TfTHacker/obsidian42-brat). This is **not as safe** as waiting for them to go through code review._

-   [Hide Sidebars on Window Resize](https://github.com/NomarCub/obsidian-hide-sidebars-on-window-resize) by `@NomarCub` Â automatically hides the sidebars when your window is resized to be narrower. There's also the similar beta plugin [Sidebar Toggler](https://github.com/chrisgrieser/obsidian-sidebar-toggler) that lets you control them from a third party window manager using a URI scheme.
-   [Tagged Documents Viewer](https://github.com/mgeduld/obsidian-tagged-documents-viewer) by `@mgeduld` Â opens a modal with scrollable content of all documents that contain a specific tag or tags.
-   [Hard Breaks](https://github.com/bkis/obsidian-hard-breaks) by `@bkis` Â turn soft line breaks in Markdown into hard line breaks automatically.

### Updates

_If you want a more comprehensive list of what plugins updated this week, check out this [plugin updates index](https://obsidian-plugin-stats.vercel.app/updates) by Ganessh Kumar._

-   The Dataview API now supports publishing notes containing codeblocks with dataview queries; they'll render as contents instead of code. [Version 2.14.0 of Digital Garden](https://github.com/oleeskild/obsidian-digital-garden/releases/tag/2.14.0) and [Obsidian Github Publisher](https://github.com/obsidianMkdocs/obsidian-github-publisher) both now support this API.

### For Developers

-   In Discord there was some [guidance on plugin settings design](https://discord.com/channels/686053708261228577/840286264964022302/999733142845915246).
-   SilentVoid is looking for a new maintainer for [Templater](https://github.com/SilentVoid13/Templater). Based on things others have said in Discord, I suspect that _even if you're not a coder,_ just helping consolidate and categorize issues helps developers save a lot of time.

## Feature Requests

-   An LSP client for Obsidian would make it easier to use things like Grammarly, Vale, advanced linting or autocompletion in code blocks and stuff. Also YAML validation and YAML autocomplete. There are [more details on Discord](https://discord.com/channels/686053708261228577/700466324840775831/997559190191079514).
-   Here's a nice write-up about [how to leverage unlinked mentions](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/expanding-the-usefulness-of-unlinked-mentions/40633), that comes complete with ideas for improvements.
-   If it would be useful for you, add your support to the feature request for [editing transclusions in place](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/enable-editing-of-transclusion-in-place/15342?u=synchronicity).

## Appearance

-   [Minimal](https://github.com/kepano/obsidian-minimal) now supports a new setting in Style Settings under Minimal > Text Â to adjust paragraph spacing, which helps with aligning reading and edit modes.

## Guides

## Housekeeping

I'm going to be out of town with just an iPad for two weeks in August, which will impact the Roundup to various degrees. Although editions will still come out, they may be limited to priority updates. Also, if I'm slower to respond to emails, that's a big reason for why.
