# Obsidian October 2022

This year our Obsidian October theme is "Back to School", for actual students and also students of life.

Whether if you're a novice or veteran, it's a perfect opportunity to share your idea and workflow with the community!

## Categories

We have the following categories this year:

- **New plugin:** a new plugin that you made
- **Plugin update:** a significant update of your existing plugin
- **New theme**: a new 1.0 compatible theme that you made
- **Theme update**: an existing theme that you made
- **Video:** Obsidian related video posted to YouTube or TikTok
- **Written content**: Obsidian related written content posted anywhere online
- **Demo vault:** a downloadable vault to demonstrate how Obsidian can be used for a specific purpose

You can participate in one or more categories. You can submit multiple entries per category.

## Awards

For each category, our judging panel will choose the top 3 winners in terms of overall quality. 3 lucky winners will also be drawn at random for each category.

In addition to the category winners, the judges will choose 3 creations that best represent our “Back to School” theme across of all the submissions:

- Best creation for college students
- Best creation for graduate students
- Best creation for a specific subject matter (e.g. history, science, languages, etc)

The winners will be featured on our official website!

## Get started

Starting now, we'll start accepting participants (abbreviated as OOers below). Anyone can participate! You'll get a special role to indicate you're participating too. You can get your role by reacting to [this Discord message](https://discord.com/channels/686053708261228577/702717892533157999/1022202550344228874).

You can sign up any time before October 31, but we encourage you to start early so you have a higher chance to finish your project.

There will be a special channel on Discord to ask questions and chat about your progress. On the forum, there is also [a mega post for OOers to share their daily progress and learnings](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/obsidian-october-2022-daily-progress-and-learnings/43767). 

## Submitting your project

Any OOer who finishes their project before the end of November 13, 2022 (extended due to 1.0 release and addition of the theme categories) [anywhere on Earth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anywhere_on_Earth) can submit via [this form](https://airtable.com/shraMn6xDv4LwgRvA) (embedded below, although it will not render if you're viewing this on GitHub).

We'll be publicly celebrating O_O contributions after the event wraps up, so you might be featured on the Obsidian website, via Twitter, or elsewhere!
