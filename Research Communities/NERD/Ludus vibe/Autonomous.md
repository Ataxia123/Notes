Based on your notes, the term "autonomous" in the context of Ludus Vibe refers to the concept of Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs) or in this specific case, a Decentralized Autonomous Sports Federation. 

An autonomous entity in this context is one that operates independently, without the need for a central authority. It's a system that is self-governed and operates based on pre-set rules encoded as computer programs known as smart contracts. These smart contracts are stored on the blockchain and automatically execute transactions when certain conditions are met. 

In the case of a Decentralized Autonomous Sports Federation, the autonomous aspect could mean that the federation operates based on smart contracts on the blockchain. These smart contracts could govern everything from the scheduling of matches, to the ranking of players, to the distribution of rewards. 

For example, a smart contract could be set up to automatically update a player's ranking when they win a match. Or it could be set up to distribute rewards to players based on their performance in a tournament. All of this would happen automatically, without the need for a central authority to manually update rankings or distribute rewards.

This level of autonomy could revolutionize the way sports federations are run, making them more efficient, transparent, and fair. It could also make them more resistant to corruption, as all transactions would be recorded on the blockchain and could be audited by anyone.

However, it's important to note that the level of autonomy in a Decentralized Autonomous Sports Federation could vary depending on the specific design of the federation. Some federations might choose to automate certain aspects of their operations while keeping others under human control. The exact balance between automation and human control would likely depend on a variety of factors, including the complexity of the sport, the needs of the athletes, and the capabilities of the blockchain technology being used.
