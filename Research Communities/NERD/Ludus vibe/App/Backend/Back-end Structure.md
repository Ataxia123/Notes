The structure of the `ludus-backend-release-deploy` directory is as follows:

|Directory/File|Description|Sub-contents|
|---|---|---|
|`Dockerfile`|A file for containerizing the application using Docker.|-|
|`docker`|Directory possibly containing Docker-related data and configurations.|Various data and configuration files related to MongoDB and Docker.|
|`support`|Directory containing support files.|`docker-compose.yml`, `privacy` (sub-directory)|
|`requirements.txt`|File listing the Python dependencies required for the project.|-|
|`app`|Main application directory.|`api`, `common`, `main.py`, `__init__.py`, `models`, `nonsql`|
|`deploy`|Directory potentially containing deployment scripts or configurations.|`docker-compose.yml`, `rerun.sh`|
|`.gitignore`|File specifying which files or directories should be ignored by Git.|-|

To draw an analogy:

- `Dockerfile` is like the foundation blueprint of a building.
- The `docker` directory is a new storage facility (compared to the previous version) that stores a variety of important materials and tools, especially those related to MongoDB.
- `support` is like a utility room, similar to the previous version.
- `app` is the core living area, like in the previous analogy.
- `deploy` is the garage, also similar to the previous analogy.

Next, I'll delve deeper into the subdirectories (`privacy`, `api`, `common`, `models`, `nonsql`) to offer a more detailed breakdown.

Here's the extended breakdown for the subdirectories in the updated code:

|Directory/File|Description|Sub-contents|
|---|---|---|
|`privacy`|Sub-directory within `support`.|`public-html` (sub-directory), `Dockerfile`|
|`api`|Sub-directory within `app` containing API-related files.|`sport.py`, `dashboard.py`, `calendar.py`, `event.py`, ...|
|`common`|Sub-directory within `app` for common utilities and files.|`jsonobject.py`, `dateutil.py`, `images.py`, `smtp.py`, `messages.py`, `prop.json`, ...|
|`models`|Sub-directory within `app` for data models.|`push.py`, `sport.py`, `rating.py`, `stats.py`, `training.py`, `challenge.py`, ...|
|`nonsql`|Sub-directory within `app` for non-SQL related files.|`sports.py`, `push.py`, `stats.py`, `users.py`, `notify.py`, `coaches.py`, `players.py`, ...|

Revisiting our building analogy:

- The `privacy` room in the `support` floor remains largely unchanged, continuing to house a special blueprint (`Dockerfile`) and a public area (`public-html`).
- The `app` floor, representing the main living area, remains bustling with various rooms (`api`, `common`, `models`, `nonsql`) housing different functionalities and tools.
- The `deploy` garage is still equipped for deployment, with a vehicle (`docker-compose.yml`) and a restart tool (`rerun.sh`).
