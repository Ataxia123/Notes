Just as the tournament starts with the kick-off, we are now ready to build and run our app:

1. Click on the "Build" button in FlutterFlow. It will build your project and provide you with a download link for your app's code.
2. Extract the downloaded code into your local development environment.
3. Navigate to the project folder via terminal and run the `flutter pub get` command to fetch the necessary dependencies.
4. Finally, run the `flutter run` command to start your app.

And there you have it, your FlutterFlow app with Firebase integrated, running just like a well-organized football tournament.

Keep in mind that while I provided a comprehensive guide, each app has unique requirements that may involve more advanced Firebase configurations. As you learn more, you can add more "teams" (services) to your "tournament" (app) to enhance its capabilities.
