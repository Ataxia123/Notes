Based on your notes, it seems like you're associating the term "Ludus vibe" with sports. Ludus is a term derived from Latin, often used to describe a playful or gaming aspect of behavior. In this context, it could be interpreted that sports are seen as a form of play or game. 

Sports, in a detailed perspective, are organized, competitive, and skill-based activities which, through casual or organized participation, aim to use, maintain, or improve physical ability and skills while providing enjoyment to participants and, in some cases, entertainment to spectators. They can take place in an indoor or outdoor setting, and they can involve individuals or teams competing against each other. 

Sports can range from more physical activities like football, basketball, and soccer, to less physically demanding activities like golf or billiards. They often involve a set of rules or customs which guide the actions of the participants. 

In addition to the physical aspects, sports can also involve strategic thinking and planning, particularly in team sports where coordination and teamwork are essential. They can also foster a sense of community among participants and fans, and they often serve as a source of social, cultural, and even national identity. 

In the context of the "Ludus vibe", sports can be seen as a form of play that brings joy, fosters competition, and promotes physical and mental well-being.
