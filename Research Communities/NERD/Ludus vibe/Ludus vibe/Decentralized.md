Based on your notes, decentralization in the context of Ludus Vibe refers to the creation of a Decentralized Autonomous Sports Federation. This involves the use of blockchain technology to create a transparent, secure, and accessible sports ecosystem. 

Decentralization is a system where decision-making is distributed or delegated away from a central, authoritative entity. It's a spectrum because it can range from partial to full decentralization. On one end, you have centralized systems where one entity holds all the power. On the other end, you have fully decentralized systems where power and control are distributed among many participants.

In a decentralized system, no single party has complete control over the entire network. Instead, control is distributed among a number of entities or nodes. This can increase the system's fairness, transparency, and resistance to censorship. 

In the context of a Decentralized Autonomous Sports Federation, decentralization could mean that athletes, coaches, and other stakeholders all have a say in the decision-making process. This could be achieved through the use of blockchain technology, which allows for the creation of decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs). 

DAOs are organizations that are run by smart contracts on the blockchain. They allow for decisions to be made in a transparent and democratic way, with each member of the organization having a vote. This could revolutionize the way sports federations are run, making them more fair and accessible.

The spectrum of decentralization in this context could range from a traditional sports federation with some blockchain features, to a fully decentralized autonomous sports federation where all decisions are made through smart contracts on the blockchain. The exact point on the spectrum would depend on the specific design of the federation.
