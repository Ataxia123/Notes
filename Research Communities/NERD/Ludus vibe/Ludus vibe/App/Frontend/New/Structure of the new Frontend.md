- `ios`: iOS-specific code and configurations.
- `README.md`: Documentation or introductory file.
- `assets`: Static assets like images, fonts, and other resources.
- `lib`: The main source code directory.
- `android`: Android-specific code and configurations.
- `.metadata`: A Flutter-specific file storing metadata.
- `test`: Directory containing test files.
- `.gitignore`: Specifies which files or directories to ignore in Git.
- `pubspec.yaml`: Flutter's configuration file, specifying dependencies and settings.
- `web`: Directory for web-specific assets and configurations.

Now, let's compare these with the directory structure of the old frontend (`ludus-frontend-devtmp`) and create a table outlining the similarities and differences.

Here's a table comparing the directory structures of the old and new frontends:

|Category|Items|
|---|---|
|**Common to Both**|`.gitignore`, `assets`, `android`, `test`, `ios`, `lib`, `README.md`, `pubspec.yaml`, `.metadata`|
|**Unique to Old Frontend**|`package-lock.json`, `.gitattributes`, `node_modules`, `flutter`, `package.json`, `.vs`, `.vscode`, `i18n`, `images`, `ludus`, `deployment_cert.der`|
|**Unique to New Frontend**|`web`|

**Observations:**

- Both frontends share core directories typical of Flutter projects, such as `lib`, `assets`, `ios`, `android`, and `test`.
- The old frontend (`ludus-frontend-devtmp`) has several items not present in the new one. These include directories and files like `node_modules`, `flutter`, `package.json`, and others, suggesting possible additional configurations or tools used in the old frontend.
- The new frontend (`ludus`) introduces a `web` directory, indicating potential support for web deployments using Flutter's web capabilities.

Given this information, when transitioning components or assets from the old frontend to the new one, you'd want to focus on the directories unique to the old frontend. Also, since the new frontend has a `web` directory, you might consider whether any web-specific adaptations or configurations are needed.
