"We have demonstrated how the bad debt incurred by AAVE on November 22nd is not the result of speculative price action or irresponsible portfolio positioning. Rather, it is due to a fundamental flaw in the liquidation logic of the protocol which guaranteed that Avi Eisenberg’s position would become undercollateralized with almost absolute certainty past some risky, but still overcollateralized portfolio health. We have termed this dynamic, a toxic liquidation spiral."

They sold way under floor last liq crunch

I'm sure the smart ones made a few houses

Couldn't tell ya but I see what you mean

***

It's just a hunch too I mean bend still had to clear bad debt from azuki but it's a way easier job than millions in dust or what Avi had happen

***

**Forwarded from [Plat0x.eth | Σ🧠Ξ](https://t.me/Plat0x_eth)**

Because it's so hard to have a huge position on NFTs
