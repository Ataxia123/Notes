"We have demonstrated how the bad debt incurred by AAVE on November 22nd is not the result of speculative price action or irresponsible portfolio positioning. Rather, it is due to a fundamental flaw in the liquidation logic of the protocol which guaranteed that Avi Eisenberg‚Äôs position would become undercollateralized with almost absolute certainty past some risky, but still overcollateralized portfolio health. We have termed this dynamic, a toxic liquidation spiral."

Thing is you should be able to predict which positions will go bad

I wonder how much money people made liquidating apws

**Forwarded from [Plat0x.eth | Œ£üß†Œû](https://t.me/Plat0x_eth)**

They sold way under floor last liq crunch

**Forwarded from [Nobody](https://t.me/NobodyDoesCrypto)**

I'm sure the smart ones made a few houses

***

**Forwarded from [Plat0x.eth | Œ£üß†Œû](https://t.me/Plat0x_eth)**

And actually NFT liquidations are better to avoid bad debt

If you think about it

Couldn't tell ya but I see what you mean

***

**Forwarded from [Plat0x.eth | Œ£üß†Œû](https://t.me/Plat0x_eth)**

It's just a hunch too I mean bend still had to clear bad debt from azuki but it's a way easier job than millions in dust or what Avi had happen

***

**Forwarded from [Plat0x.eth | Œ£üß†Œû](https://t.me/Plat0x_eth)**

Because it's so hard to have a huge position on NFTs
