# Consumer Brief: Lens and CyberConnect

## Key Trends

Two of the leading decentralized social protocols, [Lens](https://www.lens.xyz/) and [CyberConnec](https://cyberconnect.me/)t, have released new versions recently that further increase the feature potential of the platforms. Both of the upgrades rearchitect the profile to be more flexible and native while adding new features around extendability and monetization.

### Lens Protocol

The new Lens Protocol [update](https://mirror.xyz/lensprotocol.eth/-hJH-2IYSe56rK7IEdwSI17hUWt-paTyAs1r4Zes0uQ), V2, is a significant step forward in the progression of the Lens ecosystem. This updated version brings an optimized codebase, leading to improved readability and a more user-friendly experience for developers. It streamlines the integration of Web3 actions into a variety of applications and also facilitates the addition of Web3 social features.

Key upgrades in Lens Protocol V2:

- **Open Actions**: This feature, designed to enhance user experience, supports the incorporation of external smart contract actions on Lens publications, and even extends to cross-chain actions with oracle support.
- **Value Sharing**: This is a major move towards building a self-sustaining economy within the platform. It paves the way for value sharing among users, algorithms, curators, and applications.
- **ERC-6551 Token Standard**: In an effort to improve security and flexibility, this token standard has been adopted, allowing value to be linked to profiles, rather than the owner's address. The on-chain blocking and Profile Guardian mechanisms further enhance the security setup.

Since the introduction of V2 features on Lens, Polygon-based ERC-6551 accounts now constitute the majority of daily deployments among EVM chains, and over [30%](https://twitter.com/SeaLaunch_/status/1684959233568112641?s=20) of which are anchored to Lens-based profiles.

The evolution of Lens Protocol to its V2 version marks a substantial advancement for developers. Central to this evolution is the shift towards a more profile-centric approach. This offers individual users, groups, and even enterprises the ability to establish and monetize their brand across the Lens ecosystem. Users can port followers and content seamlessly, further expanding their reach and influence within the digital space.

### Cyberconnect

In parallel, [CyberConnect V3](https://link3.to/cyberconnect/post/92e4477c7833a3e8a793c14e8ec884421a5c30edc9afb06d5ce2177ff22c074a) seeks to circumvent existing barriers and augment user experience. CyberConnect V3 builds upon a robust infrastructure, integrating improved privacy safeguards and introducing CyberID which simplifies user identity management.

Key features of CyberConnect V3 encompass:

- **CyberAccount**: An ERC-4337-compatible identity infrastructure for seamless authentication and account management.
- **CyberGraph**: A censorship-resistant database that chronicles user content and social connections, contributing to enhanced data control.
- **CyberNetwork**: A Layer-2 solution ensuring gas-efficient and scalable network operations, emphasizing the provision of cost-effective transactions.

At the time of writing, around 93,000 CyberAccounts have been registered within a few days. The updated features are designed to foster a cohesive Web3 social experience, accommodating users unfamiliar with cryptocurrency. Cyberconnect plans to deploy on several new Layer-1 and Layer-2 solutions in the coming weeks, aiming to expand the scope of the Web3 social experience.

### Looking Ahead

Lens and Cyberconnect are increasingly emphasizing profile-centric features that leverage the unique capabilities of Web3. This shift demonstrates an intent to make social media platforms more personalized, empowering users by granting them greater control over their online identities. For creators, there is the possibility of easier monetization, facilitated by blockchain-based models that can enable direct compensation and new business models. Additionally, these platforms foster a seamless online digital experience, encouraging an interoperable and portable experience.

Despite the innovation of Web3 protocols, established Web2 platforms aren't standing still. They're actively experimenting with Web3 features, as seen by the growing popularity of digital collectible payments to NPC imitations on TikTok Live and Twitter's plans to offer new creator monetization methods. Reddit's recent initiative to integrate tokens and NFTs into certain subcommunities further underscores this trend.

Nonetheless, the competition between Web2 and Web3 is fraught with challenges. The large user base and entrenched market presence of Web2 platforms could overshadow the growth of emerging Web3 platforms. However, the integration of Web3 principles by these established platforms could catalyze the mainstream adoption of Web3 technologies, promoting wider acceptance of blockchain-centric systems.

Despite potential threats from Web2 platforms, the inherent advantages of decentralization, such as robust data control, increased transparency, and fairer monetization models, may continue to attract users to pure Web3 applications. As Web2 platforms embrace Web3 features, the social media landscape is set for a dramatic transformation. While the outcome of this competition is uncertain, it will inevitably shape the future of social media, influencing creators, users, and the wider digital community.

Worldcoin (WLD), the indigenous token of the privacy-focused digital identity project spearheaded by OpenAI co-founder Sam Altman, experienced a significant 33% value surge following its [listing](https://cointelegraph.com/news/worldcoin-launch-raises-eyebrows-as-wld-price-notches-a-double-digit-gain) on several major cryptocurrency exchanges on July 24. The token's rollout entailed the release of 143 million WLD, out of which 100 million was designated for market makers, while the remaining tokens were allocated to investors who participated in iris scanning during the pre-launch phase. The Worldcoin project is a comprehensive initiative encompassing the WLD token, the World App application, and the World ID credential. The latter serves as a proof of humanhood and is generated when a user undergoes an iris scan.

### Google Play allows blockchain-based elements

[Google Play](https://www.coindesk.com/web3/2023/07/12/google-play-changes-policy-on-tokenized-digital-assets-allowing-nfts-in-apps-and-games/) has announced a change in its policy, now allowing developers to incorporate NFTs and other digital assets into their applications and games. To maintain user trust, developers must clearly state that their app includes blockchain-based elements. These changes provide opportunities to reimagine traditional games with user-owned content and incentivize user loyalty through unique NFT rewards.

### OpenSea Deals

OpenSea introduced a new feature called ["Deals"](https://www.coindesk.com/web3/2023/07/20/opensea-makes-deals-launches-peer-to-peer-nft-swaps/) that facilitates peer-to-peer NFT swaps, thereby improving the trading experience and enhancing trust. With this feature, users can trade NFTs directly with one another and even include WETH to make trades more attractive. To create a deal, users specify the recipient and select up to 30 NFTs along with any WETH amount to be included in the swap. Both sides of the trade must involve NFTs from the same chain and verified collections. Although gas fees will apply, OpenSea won't charge any fees or pay creator royalties for Deals swaps. This feature aims to foster more active participation in NFT communities and reduce risks associated with off-platform transactions.

### Gnosis Card

Gnosis is launching [Gnosis Card](https://techcrunch.com/2023/07/17/gnosis-has-a-visa-card-that-lets-you-spend-self-custodial-crypto-in-europe-soon-us-and-hong-kong), a Visa card that enables users to spend funds from self-custodial crypto wallets in places where Visa is accepted, thus bridging the gap between cryptocurrency and traditional payment methods. Initially rolling out in the U.K. and EU with expansion plans for the U.S., Brazil, Mexico, Singapore, and Hong Kong, the Gnosis Card is part of a larger initiative aimed at fostering mainstream acceptance of crypto assets. The project partners with Monerium, enabling users to connect their wallets to a European bank account number (IBAN). It also launched Gnosis Pay, a toolkit allowing other crypto wallets to create versions of the Gnosis Card. This initiative comes in response to a growing shift from centralized exchanges to self-custodial wallets in the crypto space

### Orb Communities

Orb, a social application built on Lens Protocol, has recently introduced [Orb Communities](https://mirror.xyz/orbapp.eth/s5HNwiDup4sw2nbDi8FgZmlcpR6qIulTsW5qh6KRT0I).

## Chartbook

### Ethereum NFT Marketplaces

![](https://cdn.sanity.io/images/2bt0j8lu/production/6bc6396568b7ed5035bda907f950305ada12fc81-1600x900.jpg?w=714&fit=max&auto=format&dpr=3 "View full size")

Ethereum-based marketplaces have been experiencing a severe downturn, with daily transactions registering a substantial decline of over 80% since March. This downtrend is largely attributable to the prevailing bearish market sentiment stemming from the downturn in PFP communities.

The Azuki Elementals fumble from a few weeks ago has notably exacerbated this trend, causing a sharp drop in floor prices for most blue-chip collections. Of particular note is the Bored Ape Yacht Club, which has witnessed a decline of over 40% since January.

### Solana NFT Marketplaces

Conversely, NFT transactions based on the Solana blockchain have demonstrated relative stability in contrast to their Ethereum counterparts. In particular, Tensorswap, a professional trading platform on Solana, has progressively gained market share against its established competitor, Magic Eden. This growth can largely be attributed to its ongoing airdrop campaign.

### Consumer Applications

CyberConnect has experienced a notable decrease in user activity, with the monthly user base showing a 50% decline. The spike in June’s activity may be attributable to the announcement of the platform’s CYBER token.
