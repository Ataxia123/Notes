# Sound: A Look At Long Tail Creator Monetization

## Key Insights

- The vast majority of content creators on traditional platforms struggle to make significant income: **97.5% of YouTubers make less than the poverty line** in the United States.
- Web3 platforms present a potential solution for creator monetization: **direct monetization**. **Web3 platforms, such as Sound, can empower creators to generate meaningful revenue from their top few hundred fans**, instead of millions of loose fans.
- **Web3 content platforms introduce digital scarcity** outside of the core product, retaining the free-to-consume nature of Web2 while offering new features derived from Web3.
- Web3 platforms could also introduce **participation in the creative process, exclusive access to unique communities, and rare collectibles more generally.**
- **Web3 platforms still face several risks, including distribution, potential lack of feature defensibility, and demand-side incentivization.** Projects will have to solve these to have a shot at unseating their Web2 counterparts.

There are a lot of content creators on the internet.

There aren’t a lot of content creators making real money on the internet. About [97.5% of YouTubers](https://influencermarketinghub.com/creator-economy-stats/#toc-5) don’t make enough to clear the poverty line in the United States. That’s only looking at Youtubers with 20,000 views per day, which are likely to be full-time or at least part-time creators. Other content platforms exhibit similar power law dynamics: Top creators rake in millions, the masses make little to nothing.

This dynamic holds because it is profitable for today’s dominant platforms. Most content platforms (e.g YouTube) make more money off of advertising by pushing people towards already-dominant creators instead of surfacing newer ones. The incentives end up pushing the limits of the power law distribution as much as possible.

Web3 platforms can alter this paradigm by enabling the rest of the field to make a living.

Web3 content platforms like [Sound](https://www.sound.xyz/) and others monetize content consumption directly, rather than the indirect ad-driven monetization used in Web2. Some platforms that have taken this approach include [Sound](https://www.sound.xyz/), Lens and others. For creators, direct monetization means that finding a few hundred fans willing to buy $10 digital collectibles could be equally lucrative as consistently generating millions of viewers.

It was long held that as internet platforms moved towards everything-is-free economics, consumers' willingness to pay for content would approach zero. If that was true, then collection-based Web3 platforms have no hope. However, [sticker monetization](https://fortune.com/2023/07/28/pinkydoll-fedha-sinon-earns-7000-dollars-a-day-gang-gang-ice-cream-so-good-npc/) on platforms like TikTok seems to invalidate that thesis.

Unfortunately for Web3 platforms, TikTok’s success also poses a big threat. Tech startups generally bank on larger incumbents not being agile enough to adapt to and incorporate new value propositions. That’s how you get a TikTok in the first place – it wasn’t due to a shortage of engineers that Facebook didn’t create a short-form video app before it was too late, it was due to a lack of agility in reacting to a new content format.

TikTok’s speed both generally and specifically in the case of integrating small-scale direct monetization is one of many risks to Web3 platforms explored in this piece. With Sound as our main case example, we look to see if Web3 platforms can navigate past these risks and unlock the next leg up in Web3 usage – ushering in a new paradigm in long-tail creator monetization.

## Unlocks From Web3 Monetization - A Look at Sound XYZ

Generally speaking, Web3 content platforms monetize by creating digital scarcity outside of the core product.

Let’s look at Sound as an example. First, the problem with the current monetization scheme in music: It takes [1 million streams to make $4,000](https://soundcamps.com/blog/how-to-get-1-million-streams-on-spotify/#:~:text=%244000%20for%20each%20million%20streams) on Spotify. It’s hard to get 100,000 people to listen to your song just one time, let alone 10 times. Even if a musician successfully pulls that feat off, they only have $4,000 to show for it. They'll have to do it again and again in order to make a sustainable living. On Sound, however, the same creator would only need 400 fans to mint an NFT of any kind for $10 to make that same $4,000. Convincing 400 people to give you 10 bucks is no easy feat, but that’s arguably more skill-based than hoping you go viral on a random trend or playlist.

![](https://cdn.sanity.io/images/2bt0j8lu/production/3acfd5fabec1c4c35d92aad7a95bda98075ac2f6-1600x900.png?w=714&fit=max&auto=format&dpr=3 "View full size")

Contrary to popular believe, the music NFT model does not necessitate a “purchase for access” model, i.e., it doesn’t force users to buy an NFT in order to listen to a song. Sound isn’t designed like this, and the market is unlikely to develop in this direction. Listeners aren’t going to go from $10 for unlimited music to $10 a song. Rather than charging users per song, artists can mint collections for a variety of different purposes:

**Pure Collectibles:** In the analog age (which continues to this very day), superfans pay premiums for vinyls, special editions, and artist-signed content. Collectible culture is almost certain to extend to the digital context. Creators could market NFT-based collectibles as rare song editions to galvanize hardcore fans to spend the extra cash.

**Indirect Content Monetization:** There’s open design space for conferring mythical “utility” to content platform NFTs. [Shibuya](https://twitter.com/shibuyaxyz), a hybrid film/short story platform, mints [Producer Passes](https://shibuyaxyz.notion.site/Shibuya-Learn-263d88f7cf074999bf035b9f99ff7231?p=cb3c0f325d3141f98eeda186bf1129c4&pm=s), which allow users to affect the plot of Shibuya’s “White Rabbit” anime in a sort of collaborative choose-your-own-adventure story. In the music world, Sound allows minters to purchase limited comment slots in a UI similar to [Soundcloud’s](https://soundcloud.com/). These comments were hugely popular on Soundcloud at one time because the slots were first come, first serve. Today, however, Sound’s comment slots have little to no value due to the lack of eyeballs pointed at its screens. If Sound gains market share as a platform, those slots could have both cultural and commercial value.

![](https://cdn.sanity.io/images/2bt0j8lu/production/41bbf10416a7c690637c330b5bec99c0d84a37d4-1600x1787.png?w=714&fit=max&auto=format&dpr=3 "View full size")

Web3 comment slots could not only gain a value similar to Soundcloud slots at their peak, but they could also introduce a financialization aspect. Financial incentives could then supercharge trends if they begin to form. These slots, especially when limited, could act almost as digital billboards for advertisers to tap into Web3 music without dominating the music NFT incentive structure.

Sound is [designed](https://docs.sound.xyz/protocol/overview/design) to facilitate indirect monetization via its customizable [mint formats](https://docs.sound.xyz/protocol/overview). This feature allows artists to mint collections according to a range of different criteria (e.g., fixed price, allow lists, dynamic price, etc.) and customize the payment flows by utilizing [0xSplits](https://www.0xsplits.xyz/) to create programmatic revenue splits between artists. These capabilities galvanize the supply side for platforms by increasing the level of granular control artists have over the minting and payment process.

Sound also features the [Golden Egg](https://sound.mirror.xyz/3_TAJe4y8iJsO0JoVbXYw3BM2kM3042b1s6BQf-vWRo), a special 1/1 version of each song awarded to a random minter of a given collection. Features like Golden Egg increase the odds of catalyzing the demand side by introducing an addictive, loot box style “[Gacha game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gacha_game)” mechanic to music collecting. If coupled with a growing presence of talented musicians on its platform, Golden Egg could catalyze accelerated adoption for Sound. But what’s the current outlook on that growth of musicians on the platform?

## Risks to Web3 Content Models

While the above features are nice, they may not be enough to unseat Web2 incumbents on their own. Web3 content platforms face several risks (on top of the thesis risk that users will want NFTs in content creation), including:

- Distribution risks
- Lack of feature defensibility
- Finding demand-side incentivization

### Distribution Risks

The vast majority of music is consumed through streaming applications. All of the big artists already have megadeals with the Spotify’s and the Apple Music’s of the world. Even if Sound can cultivate an underground or alternative scene, it may struggle to capture and sustain market share beyond that.

Consider [Tidal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tidal_(service)#History) and [Soundcloud](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SoundCloud), two alternate music platforms that lost out despite taking drastically different approaches to distribution. In Tidal’s case, offering high-quality music and exclusive access to big-name artists like Kanye West and Beyonce still wasn’t enough. Spotify and Apple Music gave access to 99% of the other top artists for a lower price, and so Tidal failed to gain and retain market share, despite being backed by big names like Jay-Z. By contrast, Soundcloud had the grassroots approach. It cultivated the very alternative scene which Sound aspires to today. By 2015, Soundcloud already had a catalog of underground, bootleg, and remixed music that dwarfed the size of Apple Music’s and Spotify’s catalogs.

It wasn’t enough. Soundcloud had the numbers, but its competitors had the top players. Without the top-of-the-market musicians, Soundcloud would soon face multiple bankruptcy scares, while Spotify would cruise to a multi-billion dollar valuation.

These risks applies beyond just music platforms. Every vertical has a set of high-profile incumbents with instant worldwide distribution at scale via consumer-default content platforms – YouTube, Twitter, HBO, Netflix, and so on. Web3 social, or Web3 music, or Web3 film and so on will all have to contend with these risks.

### Feature Defensibility

Nowadays, the best tech companies are quick to co-opt trends if they sense the potential for profits, as seen in the earlier TikTok example with sticker monetization. [Gang gang](https://fortune.com/2023/07/28/pinkydoll-fedha-sinon-earns-7000-dollars-a-day-gang-gang-ice-cream-so-good-npc/).

This risk applies more strongly to platforms like Sound that rely on NFT minting as a core differentiator. However, platforms like Lens could potentially offer expanded features like an [open social graph](/report/the-open-social-map?referrer=all-research) on top of NFT-based infrastructure.

### Demand-Side Incentivization

Much of the bull case for creator monetization focuses on, well, the creators. But even if platforms can entice prospective creators to launch on a Sound instead of a Spotify, the platforms will still have to figure out how to attract users.

So far, the data is inconclusive, with a lean towards the negative. But first, let’s look at the supply side for reference.

![](https://cdn.sanity.io/images/2bt0j8lu/production/e5b81ae65396e923a5d9eab01d2756e1f64c0005-1600x900.png?w=714&fit=max&auto=format&dpr=3 "View full size")

On the supply of new editions, Sound has seen a consistent inflow of new editions available for collectors to collect, indicating a growing – albeit still small – interest from artists in the platform. However, the picture changes once we look at minters of these editions.

![](https://cdn.sanity.io/images/2bt0j8lu/production/5e6fff6029877a8f8849528f7cfcbbbdfc31f7f6-1600x900.png?w=714&fit=max&auto=format&dpr=3 "View full size")

While there are spurts of growth, there’s no clear trend here. As supply consistently hits new highs, demand isn’t trending with it.

Ultimately both numbers are low. There’s work to be done to improve on both sides. Even if there are already legit benefits for creators to use the platform, early signs indicate the “build it and they will come” theory may be insufficient for Web3 content platforms.

## Concluding Thoughts

Web3 platforms offer a promising solution to the skewed distribution of creator monetization on the internet. By directly monetizing content consumption through NFTs and digital collectibles, creators can find economic value in a small, dedicated fanbase rather than relying on millions of viewers. However, these platforms must face challenges such as distribution, feature defensibility, and demand-side growth before they can truly transform the landscape of online content creation. With the right approach, Web3 platforms have the potential to unlock a new era of long-tail creator monetization.
