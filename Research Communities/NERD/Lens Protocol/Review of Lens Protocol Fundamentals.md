The core concepts of Lens Protocol are based on a variety of functionalities. Here's a breakdown:

- **Lens Profile**: It encompasses user identity. Every user has a profile or account that represents them in the platform. It holds user's personal data and posts.
  
- **Lens Publication**: The main function of the Lens protocol, which enables a user to create a post and share it on the platform. Publications can include text, photos, videos or any form of media that can be shared digitally.
  
- **Lens Comment**: This feature allows other users to interact with a publication by leaving comments. This increases user engagement and promotes open communication.

- **Lens Mirror**: Noted as a system functionality, it may provide duplication or backup of content for data reliability and accessibility.

- **Lens Collect**: The feature that permits users to collect or save posts. They might do this for posts they find interesting or want to read later.

- **Lens Follow**: This feature lets users follow other profiles, ensuring they regularly receive the latest updates or posts from those they follow.

- **Lens Community Multisig**: This feature may enhance community governance on Lens by allowing multiple signatures for community-driven decisions.

Each concept is designed to contribute towards user interaction and engagement, platform functionality, content sharing, and data reliability. Together, they form the fundamental operations for Lens.
