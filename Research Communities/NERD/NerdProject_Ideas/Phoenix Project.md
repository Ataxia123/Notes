I had an idea for a funding model, initially considering suggesting it for ETHos. However, I now believe it would be better as a separate project. The model aims to streamline project funding, addressing common challenges faced in the process.

Typically, when a project needs funding, they raise funds through a presale, but two common issues arise:

Inefficiency of Keeping Presale ETH: After the presale, some ETH remains idle in the team's wallet until they need to spend it.

Inflation Risk with Token Sales: Alternatively, some projects keep tokens in a team wallet and sell them when they need funds. However, this can lead to inflation as more tokens enter the market.

To overcome these challenges, my funding model introduces the concept of the PHOENIX LP. It provides a straightforward solution by allowing the presale ETH to be immediately utilized from day one in a liquidity pool (LP), generating returns right away.

Moreover, the model ensures the project has a steady stream of income without causing inflation, as the tokens are not sold directly.

By developing this funding model as a separate project, we could secure our own funding first and then apply it to other projects. In future iterations, I intend to explore additional enhancements, such as enabling airdrops with no risk of causing a price crash. This would enable a fair distribution of tokens without adversely affecting their value.

Through this innovative approach, the funding model aims to offer projects a more efficient, sustainable, and fair method for funding their development and growth.

ðŸ‘† I used chat GPT to write that because I was struggling to make it coherent ðŸ™ƒ

Can you read the graphic... Looks like telegram wrecked the resolution

nice high res is better

At0x.eth | Nerd Finance, [7/31/23 6:05â€¯PM]
looks like its doable with delegations

At0x.eth | Nerd Finance, [7/31/23 6:05â€¯PM]
tbh

Yea but as with everything it requires waiting for the team to finish... Also with a MCap for ETHos this low, if we started this as its own project it could easily get more funding on its own

At0x.eth | Nerd Finance, [7/31/23 6:13â€¯PM]
no that was the old team

At0x.eth | Nerd Finance, [7/31/23 6:13â€¯PM]
now we start a working group on the subject

May be but my hyperactive imagination is imagining a meteoric rise like OHM

Also I've figured out the maths for an infinitely regressive release schedule, where it approaches zero, but never gets there.

So the funding goes on indefinitely... Reducing in value each time, but I guess this is more of an initial funding model before the team gains alternative sources of funding... Basically to start them off before their project starts working
