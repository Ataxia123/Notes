Before the tournament can take place, we need to organize it. Similarly, the first step is to set up your Firebase project. To do this:

1. Go to the Firebase console ([https://console.firebase.google.com](https://console.firebase.google.com/)).
2. Click on "Add project" and name it to match your app.
3. Leave Google Analytics enabled (if required) and click "Create Project".
