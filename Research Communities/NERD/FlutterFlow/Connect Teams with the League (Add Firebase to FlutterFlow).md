This is like making sure all teams are registered and ready to play in the tournament. Similarly, we now connect our Firebase project to FlutterFlow:

1. In the Firebase console, navigate to "Project Settings" and click on the "</>" icon to add Firebase to your web app.
2. Register the app by entering an app nickname.
3. You'll receive a Firebase SDK snippet that contains the config object, copy that.
4. In FlutterFlow, open your project and navigate to "Project Settings", then "Integrations".
5. Paste the Firebase config object and save the settings.
