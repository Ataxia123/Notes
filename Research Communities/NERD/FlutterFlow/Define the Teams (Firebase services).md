Just as each team in a tournament has unique skills and roles, each Firebase service offers different capabilities. We'll add the necessary services, which in this case are Firebase Auth and Firestore:

1. Click on "Authentication" in the Firebase console, then "Get Started".
2. Enable the necessary sign-in methods, like "Email/Password", "Google", etc.
3. Then go to "Cloud Firestore", click "Create Database" and select "Start in Production Mode" or "Start in Test Mode" based on your requirement.
