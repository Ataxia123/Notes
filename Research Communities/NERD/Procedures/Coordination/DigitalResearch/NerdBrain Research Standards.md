The [[Manifesto_GBA_research_process_first_version]] outlines a research process that can be conducted using blockchain technology. The process is based on the principles of Submission, Assessment, Funding, Execution, Executable Result, and Loop (SAFER-Loop). The manifesto also discusses the role of software in scientific research, emphasizing the importance of security and replicability in digital research processes. 

The research process is managed by a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) and involves the creation of an on-chain data structure for project repositories and research proposals. Voting procedures are implemented for the acceptance or rejection of proposals and research results. The manifesto also highlights the importance of reproducibility and the 5 R principle in research: relevance, rapid and recursive application, redefining rigor, reporting on resources required, and replicability.

To implement this in the context of the [[README]], the NerdBrain project could adopt the principles of the SAFER-Loop for its research efforts. The project could use a DAO to manage the open-source repository on Github, allowing for decentralized management of the research process. 

The voting procedures outlined in the manifesto could be used to decide on the acceptance or rejection of contributions to the repository. This would ensure that only high-quality, relevant content is added to the NerdBrain. 

The emphasis on software in the manifesto aligns with the NerdBrain project's use of Obsidian and its plugins. The project could ensure that all software used is secure and replicable, in line with the manifesto's guidelines. 

Finally, the NerdBrain project could strive to adhere to the 5 R principle in its research efforts, ensuring that all content added to the repository is relevant, rapidly and recursively applied, rigorously defined, reports on resources required, and is replicable. This would ensure the quality and usefulness of the NerdBrain as a knowledge resource.
