> ##### Adventure Maps
>
>Maps that appear in this adventure are for the DM's eyes only.
>
>A map not only shows an adventure location in its entirety but also shows secret doors, hidden traps, and other elements the players aren't meant to seeâ€”hence the need for secrecy.
>
>Maps are best used to show multiroom lairs and other locations that have many places to explore. Therefore, not every location needs a map.
>
>When the players arrive at a location marked on a map, you can either rely on a verbal description to give them a clear mental picture of the location, or you can draw what they see on a separate piece of graph paper, copying what's on your map while omitting details as appropriate.
>
>***Scale and Grid.*** A scale allows you to measure distances and dimensions accurately, which is important for combat encounters, magical effects, and light sources, among other things. Indoor maps use grid squares that are either 5 feet on a side or 10 feet on a side.

>***Compass Rose.*** A compass rose comes in handy when you're describing locations. For instance, you might need to tell players about "barrels along the north wall" or "the staircase descending to the west."
