On the knowledge graph, a neuron is the basic functional unit composed a set of nodes rather than an individual data point. In this framework, a neuron represents a group or cluster of interconnected nodes within the knowledge graph.

Instead of a single node representing a neuron, a neuron now encompasses multiple nodes that are closely related and function together as a unit. These nodes within the neuron can have attributes, relationships, and connections with other nodes both within and outside of the neuron.

By redefining a neuron as a set of nodes, the knowledge graph can capture more complex relationships and interactions between entities. The interconnected nodes within a neuron work collectively to process and transmit information, similar to how a group of biological neurons in the brain function together to perform cognitive tasks.

The connections between nodes within a neuron enable the propagation of knowledge and the ability to traverse the graph to retrieve related information. The set of nodes within a neuron can be seen as a cohesive unit that contributes to the overall functioning and behavior of the knowledge graph.

This redefined concept of a neuron as a set of nodes in a knowledge graph allows for more nuanced representation and computation of knowledge. It facilitates the modeling of complex systems and enables advanced reasoning and inference tasks within the graph.
