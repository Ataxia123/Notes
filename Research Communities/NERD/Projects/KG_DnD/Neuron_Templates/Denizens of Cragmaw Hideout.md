As the game master, you're aware that it was actually a small group of Goblin Scouts hiding in the dense foliage around the cave entrance, watching Ulthan and the party. These scouts are part of the Cragmaw tribe and have been stationed here to alert the rest of the hideout to any incoming threats. 

Their stealth and camouflage have allowed them to remain undetected during Ulthan's cursory survey of the area. However, now that the party has been alerted to a possible presence, there's an increased chance they might be discovered if the party were to investigate further.

Remember, however, the players aren't aware of this information unless they've successfully detected or interacted with the scouts somehow. The encounter depends on the players' actions and decisions.
