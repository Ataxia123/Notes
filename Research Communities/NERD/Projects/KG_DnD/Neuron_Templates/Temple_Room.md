# Room 1

This large room appears to be part of an abandoned temple. The walls are made of smooth, unadorned stone that echoes with an eerie, hollow sound if you knock against them. Tall, narrow arched windows in the walls let in slivers of scant light, which reveal the dust motes hanging in the air.

The room has two key features. One, a broken stone altar at the far end, bereft of any markings. It might have been desecrated or simply withered with time. Near it, a large statue in the corner is laid on the ground, its features weathered away into unrecognizability. 

Two, a mysterious, silver runic circle etched onto the floor in the center of the room. The circle pulses faintly with a blue light. At the edges of the room, four wooden doors lead out in different directions.
