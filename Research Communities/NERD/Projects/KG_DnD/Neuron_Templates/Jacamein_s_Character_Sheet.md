**Backstory:**
This Orc was left orphaned and at the mercy of the Underdark after a cave-in cut off his clan's access to the surface. He was taken in by a group of Underdark scouts, who taught him the paths and tunnels beneath the world's surface. Showing a surprising affinity for magic, he began to study the arcane arts and eventually became a Wizard, turning his uncanny survival instincts toward enhancing his ability to support and defend his newfound family. Today, this Orc Wizard uses his knowledge of the Underdark and his magic to navigate the caverns, protect his clan, and search for a way back to the world above ground.
