Within the depths of Cragmaw Hideout, things are deceptively calm. A watchful silence hangs in the air, punctuated by the occasional echo of scattered stones and distant hushed voices. As the party approaches the ominous mouth of the cave, a chill runs down their spines, an intuitive warning of the lurking dangers they're about to face.

To the far west inside the goblins' lair, shuffling and muttering of six hideout goblins can be heard. They're engaged in their individual tasks: cleaning weapons, counting looted treasure, sharpening arrows. Despite their unruly demeanour, an air of alertness suggests they're more than ready to face an attack.

Deeper within the heart of the hideout, in a large chamber adorned with stolen fineries and grotesque trophies, Yeemik, the goblin subchief, paces restlessly. The goblins whisper amongst themselves, he has been argumentative with Klarg, the Bugbear Chief, and is desperate to wrestle power away.

Klarg himself resides in the furthest depths of the hideout. In his imposing chamber, adorned with the spoils of countless raids, the bugbear chief rests with smug superiority, oblivious to Yeemik's ambitious designs.

In the dimly lit corner of a nearby chamber, the captive dwarf, Gundren Rockseeker, is noticeably weary but displays a spark of steely resolve in his eyes. He is bound and watched over by a goblin guard, waiting for his chance to escape or be rescued.

The seconds tick on, wrapping Cragmaw Hideout in a shroud of dangerous anticipation, as if the cave itself is holding its breath for the storm it senses on the horizonâ€”the arrival of the adventurers.
