ideally when we are doing science when we're doing research we should be doing it in a way that is public and by public what I mean is that as the researchers we are going to make make information about the study available to others in other words to hopefully to the public at large that's actually something that I think is a little bit of an issue which is that research reports are often much more available to professors at universities or to other people other researchers and if you want to get them sometimes that costs you some money and quite a lot of money to to purchase them from the journals which they're published unless they're a bit older or they're in a journal that provides them for free so you know ideally these are available to everyone in reality there are some issues with getting access to them and actually i should mention that as a student at nau one of the best things about being a student or a teacher at a large University is that the libraries have purchased access to pretty much every journal out there so you can get research on essentially everything well you're a student and I hope that you learn to appreciate that and take advantage of that but there's anyway this is ideal in science that we make it public that we make the information about our study available to other people the most common the most common way in which that is done would be where we would publish which I was just mentioning we would publish a research report in particular kind of journal science journals are quite different from from regular magazines they look similar in certain ways but they're quite different the biggest way in which they're different is that the reports before they're published they undergo a process called called peer review so these are peer-reviewed journal articles and the term peer you know in everyday language we're talking about someone who is your equal someone who's sort of in the same group maybe the same age group in this context is very similar but what we're talking about are other people who are probably doing research in the same area so if you are publishing a study on so in social psychology maybe something to do with with obedience then you are going to be reviewed your work is going to be reviewed by peers who are also experts in social psychology and probably even doing work in in the on researching obedience and now when we say that the thing is reviewed by your peers usually what this means is it's more like it means it's there sort of it's attacked by a school of vicious piranhas who are trying to rip your study apart and I say that jokingly but really the idea is that if your study its high quality if you did everything right if your research methods are solid and the conclusions your drawing are justified by what you found and everything is good then no matter how much we try to find flaws in it and rip it apart it should withstand that attack and so the idea is although I may not feel very good for to undergo this peer review process because you're going to get a lot of critiques a lot of criticisms even though that may not feel great the idea is that these your peers your fellow scientists are doing you a favor by really trying to temper your study and now sometimes it doesn't get into the journal and you have to go back in and redo your research or add on to your research or address some significant problems and then try to come back and publish again and so the idea of things being public the idea is that this makes it possible to do a number of different things like I was just saying you can through peer review and also just after its published even the criticisms don't end there but Sir peer review and through seeing it out there publicly other scientists come can come and they can evaluate it or criticize it or critique what you did and you'll get some really you'll get some really intense debates sometimes with an article that is a journal article is published and then in the same journal they'll often get other scientists yeah it made it to the peer review process but look at other scientists to still nevertheless be meant we disagree with the conclusions of the study and so you get a very lively debate out there in the open in public where everyone can see it and everyone can potentially join in the other main reason that I'd like to know for for why we want things to be public is that this allows you to replicate you can do what's called a replication study the idea is we don't want to spend we want to put too much confidence in any one study even if it makes it through the peer review process there could still be problems with it maybe there's some mistakes that you didn't catch that nobody else caught when they were reviewing it and now it's out there and it's published and you're basically inadvertently lying to people i mean not lying but you're you're presenting something that is not true and we want to be able to catch that or maybe you are deliberately lying maybe you're actually engaging in fraud in which case we definitely want to catch that so you've crafted this beautiful sounding study it goes it's wives through peer review because all it all sounds perfect but you just made it up and this has unfortunately happened from time to time and scientists have been caught doing this and and lost you know their careers over it but one of the one of the best ways to check whether something is true is not to rely on a single study a single study is a good reason to say that's interesting it looks like there's something there let's check it out but if we really want to be confident that something is true about the world we need to replicate that and the idea is some other scientists in some other lab who doesn't have your biases who is maybe going to not make the same mistakes that you made in your study can lead the very very detailed report so so i should mention that you know these these reports are extremely and you will read a number of these in this class and you will write one yourself these are extremely detailed these are extremely detail they give all of the information about the participants what were their characteristics how many of them were there and what exact methods did you use for running this uniport for exposing them to a particular treatment or whatever it was that you did you're going to give all of the details because the idea is someone should be able to not only check it over and say yeah that sounds good but someone should even be able to try it themselves if they want to so if I'm skeptical of your study or I just want to you know be able to check the results the best thing I can do is say hey I'm going to do exactly what he did he did XY and Z and he got this particular result so I'm going to do exactly that i'm going to do XY and Z and I'm going to see if I get the same result and obviously if I guess the same result if I have succeeded in replicating then that strengthens our confidence that what we're seeing is is really there the other hand if I fail to replicate then then obviously is going to decrease our confidence and there are a lot of examples of very interesting remarkable surprising mind-blowing research findings where a study came out and nobody could believe how you know it just blew away our preconceptions of how the war worse and it seems to be done really well and it was done by reputable scientists and it passed through peer review and then a bunch of different scientists in different areas of the world all independently try to replicate it and they all fail nobody can get the same results again and that doesn't mean that the original scientists were you know being fraudulent they might have been but it at least means that something probably went wrong you know they screwed something up somewhere or they just got unlucky and it looked like there was something happening just by chance and there wasn't so replication studies are an absolutely critical part of this process and they're only possible because we make the scientific method public we make your reports of what we have done of our studies public so that everyone can see them evaluate them critique them and replicate them
