>[!cue] Prompt:
>Extract all the individual topics of [[Raw_LK99_Transcript]] in a list, come up with a naming convention for the files and have each point to an empty file to best answer [[202308111005_Geopolitics_Question]] 

Based on the content of the [[Raw_LK99_Transcript]], here is a list of individual topics:

1. Introduction to LK 99 superconductor
2. Background on superconductors
3. Reports and leaks about LK 99
4. Flaws and lack of replication in the reports
5. Importance of semiconductors in the green transition
6. Challenges in transmitting power over long distances
7. Local electrical concerns in the United States
8. Need for legal structure to enable power transfer across jurisdictions
9. High voltage lines and their limitations
10. Legal overhaul required for the green transition
11. Importance of physical science breakthroughs
12. Need for multiple acts of Congress

To create a naming convention for the files, we can use the following format: 

- Topic 1: [[LK99_Introduction]]
- Topic 2: [[Superconductors_Background]]
- Topic 3: [[Reports_and_Leaks]]
- Topic 4: [[Flaws_and_Replication]]
- Topic 5: [[Semiconductors_and_Green_Transition]]
- Topic 6: [[Challenges_in_Transmitting_Power]]
- Topic 7: [[Local_Electrical_Concerns]]
- Topic 8:[[ Legal_Structure_for_Power_Transfer]]
- Topic 9: [[High_Voltage_Lines]]
- Topic 10: [[Legal_Overhaul_for_Green_Transition]]
- Topic 11: [[Importance_of_Physical_Science_Breakthroughs]]
- Topic 12: [[Acts_of_Congress_for_Green_Transition]]

Each file should be created and left empty for now, as they will be filled with relevant information to answer the [[202308111005_Geopolitics_Question]]
