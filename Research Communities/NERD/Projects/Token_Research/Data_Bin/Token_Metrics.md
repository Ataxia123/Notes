The token supply is well structured and in line with industry standards. As seen in Table 3.1,
the token supply has a hard cap of 3 billion and a total cap of 10 billion giving $EARN an
inherently deflationary design. In addition, part of the platform fees will be used to buy back
$EARN from the market, increasing deflation. The token distribution depicted in Table 3.
also aligns with industry standards. The only suggestion would be to separate the “treasury
allocation” from “allocations for further rounds”, as this creates a lack of transparency.


## 3.1.2 TOKEN UTILITY

_Score: 7 /_

The $EARN token brings several utilities within the ecosystem; generally speaking, the more
utility applications, the better. Below, each utility is analysed in detail.

**Payment in the ecosystem**

Utilising the native token as a form of exchange introduces another use case for the token,
but it also presents particular challenges, such as:

- Requiring users to acquire $EARN to perform basic functions on the platform may
    increase friction and diminish the overall user experience.
- Since $EARN is traded on the open market, price fluctuations can occur, which may
    become dramatic during extreme market conditions.
       o If services are priced in $EARN, a sophisticated balancing mechanism will be
          needed to maintain consistent dollar value pricing. However, whether this is
          feasible during periods of high volatility is uncertain.

**Staking mechanism with privileged action**

Incorporating the community into the governance process is an effective strategy to boost
engagement and enhance platform performance. However, more information is needed
about:

- The amount of $EARN which must be staked for specific actions.
- The size of the rewards.
    o If rewards are insufficient, users may not be motivated to perform desired
       actions.
- The implementation process of specific actions, such as removing a loan offer, lacks
    clarity.
- It is unclear if a quorum is necessary to delist a loan offer.
- The percentage of votes needed for a decision is not specified.
- Whether the users' decision is final or subject to review by the earn team remains
    unknown.

When the community plays a significant role in the governance of service offerings, the
mechanisms must be carefully designed, as the platform’s success depends heavily on user


participation. Given the importance of this aspect, the currently available information seems
insufficient. Providing more comprehensive details on the governance structure, guidelines,
and the potential impact of user input on the platform's growth and evolution would be
beneficial to ensure that users are engaged and contribute to the decision-making process.

**Promotional spots bidding**

The information regarding the bidding mechanics could be more extensive, making it easier
to understand the process thoroughly. To gain a clearer picture, it would be helpful to know:

- The amount of $EARN required to secure a promotional spot.
    o Does the system operate as a bidding auction, with the highest bidders
       winning the promotional spots?
- The duration for which a promotional spot is guaranteed.

**Grants & Incentives**

More information on what actions will be incentivised and the grant approval process will
work.

**Fee distribution**

More explanation is needed on the exact fee distribution methods.

```
As depicted in Table 3.3, the valuation for the seed round is USD 15 million, which appears
relatively high, given the prevailing funding environment. The token price difference between
the seed round and public listing is 438%, which falls on the lower end of the industry
standard spectrum. The project must showcase an outstanding performance outlook to


warrant such a pricing structure. This is particularly important, as EARN doesn’t have a
revolutionary product and operates within a highly competitive market segment.

The vesting and cliff schedule shown in Table 3.4 adheres to industry standards, but
information on the exact vesting mechanism needs to be included.

Additionally, it would be helpful to understand the rationale behind the ecosystem bucket
unlocking with every block.

## 3.1. 6 TOKEN BUYBACK PLAN

_Score: 4 /_

It's encouraging to see that the team has incorporated a token buyback mechanism, but
more information is needed regarding the implementation process for the token buyback.

- Not clear how much $EARN will be bought back from the market.
- Not clear at which intervals or rate $EARN will be bought back from the market.
- Not apparent how much of the fees will be used to buy back %EARN.


## 3.1. 7 TOKEN GOVERNANCE

_Score: 2 /_

The only governance aspect mentioned is that $EARN stakers receive privileged actions
such as voting on listings. If $EARN stakers should be partly responsible for maintaining the
platform’s service offerings, there should be more explanation on the exact mechanisms
which go into this. If these mechanisms are poorly designed, the community will not have
enough incentives to spend time and resources governing the platform. There is also no
explanation of how the Earn Network will be governed and how decisions will be made.

## 3.1. 8 OPEN QUESTIONS

- How will the platform ensure consistent dollar value pricing for users if services are
    priced in $EARN?
- Elaborate on the decision-making authority of $EARN stakers.

    spots, and fee distribution), what proportion of benefits do stakers receive? Is there
    only one staking pool?

    o The amount of $EARN required to secure a promotional spot.
