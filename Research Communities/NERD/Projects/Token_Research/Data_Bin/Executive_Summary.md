## 2. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

## 2.1 TOKENOMICS

The $EARN tokenomics display a solid framework but could use more detail. Token supply,
distribution, and vesting/cliff schedules are aligned with industry standards, while the token
price remains lower than public sale prices, restricting seed round investors' initial gains. The
most significant issues lie in the token's usage for services, governance model, and buyback
mechanism, with insufficient information on their functionality or implementation.
It would be beneficial to see more attention paid to the entire token ecosystem,
encompassing stakeholder mapping, their roles and motivations, and how the tokenomics
can drive desired outcomes. Although perfection isn't required for a seed round project, key
mechanisms that could impact token performance need more detail.

Moving forward, utilising tools like Machinations for tokenomics simulation is advisable,
enabling visualisation of the entire token economy and highlighting stakeholder interactions
and their effects. In addition, simulations can also reveal potential vulnerabilities under
ecosystem stress.

## 2.2 TEAM

The Earn Network's core and extended team exhibit diverse expertise, commitment, and
experience, crucial for navigating the challenges and opportunities in the blockchain and
DeFi sectors. However, there are potential limitations and areas for improvement, such as
gaps in technical knowledge, regulatory compliance, and security. Addressing these
concerns could strengthen the team's foundation and make the Earn Network a more robust
investment prospect.

## 2.3 COMPETITOR ANALYSIS

The competitor analysis reveals a saturated yet rapidly evolving DeFi lending landscape,
with five significant players dominating the lending market: AAVE, JustLend, Compound,
Venus, and Morpho.

These competitors have solidified their position due to their long track record, extensive
auditing, and innovative feature sets. However, they have limitations regarding cross-chain
lending and their primary focus on experienced DeFi users. Earn Network does not have the


first-mover advantage. Still, its unique features like multi-chain support, liquid lending (i.e.,
borrowing against liquidity provisions), and the planned ability for all users to create lending
pools set it apart.

Earn aims to attract users through partnerships with real-world businesses in emerging
markets and by offering a wide range of supported coins. The project also has a high degree
of adaptability due to its multi-chain approach and the ease of adding new pools.
However, the DeFi market's growth and penetration present substantial challenges,
including attracting initial liquidity and dealing with the low to medium technical barriers
associated with DeFi protocols.

The project also operates in a legal and regulatory environment that could be significantly
affected by new laws and policies as the DeFi industry matures. As a result, Earn will need
to leverage its unique features, forge strategic partnerships, and navigate regulatory hurdles
effectively to succeed.

## 2.4 MVP QUALITY

The MVP, designed for various investment strategies, liquidity pooling, and borrowing,
displays significant strengths and potential areas for improvement. However, its core
features cater to the fundamental needs of DeFi users, including diverse lending pools,
borrowing options, and an investment overview.

The platform distinguishes itself by supporting liquid staking, allowing users to borrow
against liquidity pool tokens. Earn further sets itself apart by offering the trading of liquidity
provision tokens and offering KYC, which is made possible through soulbound NFTs.
However, the MVP faces challenges in terms of user experience, with a lack of intuitive user
flows for transaction processes and an insufficiently clear interface for non-technical users.

Notably, the absence of a confirmation page before transactions can lead to user confusion
and errors. Additionally, design issues and confusing terminology present minor obstacles to
user engagement.
The project's roadmap for 2023 outlines key milestones, including a token launch, enabling
pool creation for everyone, and a CEX listing. However, there is a distinct absence of plans
to address current UI and user experience limitations.


The biggest challenge is that the MVP does not cater to non-technical users, a core target
group Earn has identified. A notable absence of tooltips to explain various terms used on the
platform and a lack of detailed descriptions of the risks associated with borrowing
exacerbates the issue.

The project's future commitment to development and innovation is signalled by its ambition
to secure a token listing on a major exchange. Still, the roadmap needs more detailed
information about potential partnerships. In addition, while the MVP shows promise in terms
of interoperability and flexibility, with scalability to other EVM-compatible chains and
adaptability to changing market conditions, more information is needed regarding its
integration with other projects, responsiveness to user feedback, and adaptability to new
challenges or opportunities.

## 2.5 EXISTING INVESTOR ANALYSIS

The participation of respected investors such as Shima Capital, MapleBlock Capital, Mirana
Ventures, and DFG in Earn Network suggests that they recognise the project’s potential. In
addition, these investors possess a history of experience in the blockchain and DeFi sectors,
making their support a critical factor when evaluating the project's prospects.

An in-depth analysis was performed to explore potential synergies between Earn Network
and the projects featured in each investor’s portfolio. This assessment is precious as it helps
understand how these different projects could interact or collaborate with Earn Network and
provides insights into potential strategic opportunities for growth and innovation.

By pinpointing shared areas of focus, complementary technologies, or potential integration
points, this analysis could pave the way for beneficial partnerships, enhance the utility of the
respective projects, and lead to a more robust and versatile DeFi ecosystem.

Notably, despite the bearish market conditions, all investing parties actively participated in
the market throughout the downtrend. This is a positive sign as it demonstrates resilience
and confidence in the market’s long-term potential, despite short-term fluctuations. Overall,
this activity level bearish market suggests that there is still strong interest and demand for
investing in the market, which bodes well for its prospects.

Including projects with potential synergies in the investors' portfolios offers numerous
advantages. It encourages collaboration, the sharing of knowledge, and the formation of


strategic partnerships, all of which contribute to the development of innovative solutions and
improved competitiveness in the market.

Furthermore, when projects in the portfolio exhibit synergistic qualities, it opens up
opportunities for strategic partnerships and collaborations. By aligning their objectives and
leveraging complementary services, these projects can explore mutually beneficial
arrangements such as joint ventures, co-marketing initiatives, or technology integrations. As
a result, they can expand their user bases, extend their reach in the market, and enhance
their product offerings. By utilising strengths, these projects can achieve synergistic effects
that surpass what they could accomplish individually.

Moreover, the same investors have provided funding for MyCointainer, another company
managed by the founder of Earn Network. This indicates that the investors may have
confidence in Earn Network’s leadership and expertise in the industry. Therefore, the
ongoing support for Earn Network and MyCointainer can be viewed as a positive factor when
assessing the companies' positions within the blockchain and DeFi markets.

In conclusion, the involvement of these investors may reflect their trust in the Earn Network
leadership, which could be crucial in navigating the companies' development in the
competitive blockchain and DeFi landscape.
