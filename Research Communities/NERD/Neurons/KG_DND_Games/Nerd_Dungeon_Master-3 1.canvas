Here are some key locations within Phandalin:\n\n1. **Lionshield Coster**: This trading post, located near the eastern end of Main Street, is run by a merchant named Linene Graywind. It offers a variety of supplies, including weapons, armor, and adventuring gear.\n\n2. **Stonehill Inn**: Situated along Main Street, this cozy inn is ran by a friendly individual named Toblen Stonehill. It provides rooms for travelers and acts as a hub for information and rumors.\n\n3. **Phandalin Miner's Exchange**: Found near the middle of town, this establishment is managed by a dwarf named Halia Thornton. It serves as a meeting place for miners and traders, facilitating the exchange of goods and information.\n\n4. **The Sleeping Giant**: This rough and rowdy tavern lies on the western end of Main Street. It is known for its sometimes boisterous patrons and serves as a place for locals and visitors to unwind.\n\n5. **Townmaster's Hall**: Located at the northern end of Main Street, this building serves as the town's administrative center.
