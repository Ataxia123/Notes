It was here that Klarg and Yeemik concocted an elaborate ambush plan, using a false distress signal to lure the unsuspecting caravans into the jaws of their waiting forces. Many who traveled fell victim to their scheme. The road was soon feared and avoided, resulting in a significant decline in trade in that area.\n\n**3.
