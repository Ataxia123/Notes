Ulthan's Updated Inner State:

1. **Relief**: Feeling relief wash over him as his plan seems to be unfolding correctly, having managed to successfully instigate Skarg the goblin against the Redbrands.

2. **Anticipation**: With the success of his persuasion attempt, he feels anticipation and intrigue building up about what the goblins' next move will be.

3. **Caution**: Venturing deeper into the unexplored parts of the cave, Ulthan can feel a sense of caution slowly creeping in. His senses are heightened, ready to react to whatever he might encounter next.

4. **Determination**: Despite the uncertainty of what lies ahead, his determination to escape and reunite with his companions remains unscathed, providing a steady focus amidst the chaos unfolding around him.

While on the move, Ulthan now keeps a firm hand on his weapon, eyes constantly scanning the flickering shadows of the cave. He is ready to face any threats that might spring from the darkness but also hopes to find some form of assistance or advantage in this yet unexplored territory.
