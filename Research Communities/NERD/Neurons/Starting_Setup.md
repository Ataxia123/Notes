Sure, we can start with the standard initial chess board setup like this:

```
8 r n b q k b n r
7 p p p p p p p p
6
5
4
3
2 P P P P P P P P
1 R N B Q K B N R
  a b c d e f g h
```

In the above diagram:

- "r", "n", "b", "q", "k", "p" represent black's pieces: rook, knight, bishop, queen, king, pawn, respectively. 
- "R", "N", "B", "Q", "K", "P" represent white's pieces: Rook, Knight, Bishop, Queen, King, and Pawn, respectively. 

You're white and it's your move, please provide me with your next move in standard algebraic notation (e.g., "e4").
