The use of "DNA. Bonfires" as a hyperstructure case study implies that the principles of hyperstructures can be applied beyond technology.

DNA: 

- Unstoppable: DNA naturally replicates and evolves, similar to a hyperstructure. 
- Free: There is no cost to the propagation and evolution of DNA.
- Valuable: DNA contains the code of life, making it inherently valuable.
- Expansive: As life forms reproduce and evolve, the diversity and complexity of DNA expands.
- Permissionless: DNA replication and evolution are universally accessible processes that do not require approval or permission.
- Positive Sum: The propagation of DNA leads to the diversification and survival of species.
- Credibly neutral: DNA replication and evolution are not influenced by the individual carrying the DNA.

Bonfires:

- Unstoppable: Once a bonfire is lit, it continues to burn until it runs out of fuel.
- Free: The energy released by a bonfire does not come with a cost.
- Valuable: Bonfires provide light, heat, and a means to cook food, making them valuable.
- Expansive: The light and heat of a bonfire expand outward from the source.
- Permissionless: Anybody can start and benefit from a bonfire.
- Positive Sum: Multiple people can benefit from a single bonfire.
- Credibly neutral: A bonfire provides heat and light regardless of who lit it or who is around it.

Both examples illustrate how elements of Hyperstructures can be found in nature and traditional human practices. This case study demonstrates that Hyperstructures can serve as a model for efficient, equitable, and accessible systems, whether they be digital or physical.
