Users lock their tokens in exchange for interest. The unique aspect of HEX comes from its \"share\" system that calculates individual interest payouts. The number of shares a user gets depends on the length and size of their stake, and the current share rate, incentivizing long-term holding. \n\nCritics of HEX associate it with pyramid schemes due to its high interest rates and aggressive marketing, but it continues to be popular with those looking for staking profits. \n\nCurrently, the trading price of HEX sits at about $0.004195253341. The most active trading platforms for HEX are Uniswap V3 and Bitget. Moreover, HEX operates a referral program rewarding users who bring in new participants. Despite the controversy, due diligence is needed when investing in this project as with any other.","id":"c8def542804f320c","x":-6340,"y":-9959,"width":1040,"height":580,"color":"6"},

It’s called a pyramid scheme because each tier expands widely, creating the shape of a pyramid.\n\nIn the case of HEX, the criticism has been toward its high-delegated proof of stake model which may give better returns to early investors who stake more tokens. Going by the pure definition of a pyramid scheme, the model used by HEX doesn’t completely classify it as one since it doesn't rely solely on new investments to return profits to older investors. \n\nHowever, in the world of investment and particularly cryptocurrency, the term \"Pyramid Scheme\" can be used more broadly to refer to any investment where the returns for old investors are too reliant on the influx of new investment. In this view, Critics argue that HEX encourages people to lock their tokens for as long as possible and promises high returns, with bigger returns for the earliest adopters, all of which are traits modeled in pyramid schemes. Hence the controversy surrounding its structure.\n\nOnce again, it's crucial for investors to conduct extensive research before engaging with any cryptocurrency investment, understanding not only intended rewards but also potential risks.","id":"b7a6a115c8ec1dde","x":-5540,"y":-10000,"width":609,"height":524,"color":"6"},
