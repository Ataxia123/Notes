Creating a public good-based economy on a micro-scale could be demonstrated through the development of a cooperative or a community organization. The goal would be to create a model that emphasizes the communal ownership, distribution, and benefit of resources or services.

Here's a proposed step-by-step guide to create a micro economic model based on public goods:

**Step 1 - Identify a Public Good:** Start by identifying a public good that is relevant and beneficial to the community. This could be a tangible resource like a community garden, or an intangible one like a communal Wi-Fi network or an open-source software project.

**Step 2 - Form a Cooperative or Community Organization:** Gather a group of individuals who are interested in managing and benefiting from the public good. Establish an organizational structure that incorporates democratic decision-making processes and encourages participation from all members.

**Step 3 - Develop Rules for Use and Maintenance:** Develop collectively agreed-upon rules for the use and maintenance of the public good. These rules should encourage equitable use and prevent exploitation or overuse of the resource.

**Step 4 - Establish a Token Economy:** To represent value within this system, consider establishing a token economy. Tokens could be earned by contributing to the maintenance of the public good and spent to use or benefit from it. This forms a basic economy, encouraging ongoing participation and support.

**Step 5 - Refine and Expand:** As the system begins to function, refine the processes based on community feedback. Also, explore opportunities for expansion. For instance, could excess produce from a community garden be sold to create a surplus fund? Could a successful open-source software project start offering paid consulting or training services?

**Step 6 - Measure Success:** Regularly review and evaluate the projectâ€™s success based on a set of pre-determined indicators such as participation levels, equitable utilization of the public good, or the amount of token exchange taking place.

In conclusion, forming a public good-based economy on a micro scale is feasible and can serve as a practical demonstration of effectively managing resources communally. The key elements include community participation, democratic decision-making processes, and sustainable use of shared resources.
