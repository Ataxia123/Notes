Abstract
A material called LK-99®, a modified-lead apatite crystal structure with the composition (Pb10-xCux(PO4)6O
(0.9<x<1.1)), has been synthesized using the solid-state method. The material exhibits the Ohmic metal
characteristic of Pb(6s1) above its superconducting critical temperature, Tc, and the levitation phenomenon
as Meissner effect of a superconductor at room temperature and atmospheric pressure below Tc. A LK-99®
sample shows Tc above 126.85℃ (400K). We analyze that the possibility of room-temperature
superconductivity in this material is attributed to two factors: the first being the volume contraction resulting
from an insulator-metal transition achieved by substituting Pb with Cu, and the second being on-site
repulsive Coulomb interaction enhanced by the structural deformation in the one-dimensional(D) chain
(Pb2−O1/2−Pb2 along the c-axis) structure owing to superconducting condensation at Tc. The mechanism of
the room-temperature Tc is discussed by 1-D BR-BCS theory.
I. INTRODUCTION
For over 110 years since Onnes's 1911 discovery of superconductivity, scientists have searched for
room-temperature superconductors, materials that exhibit zero resistance to electrical current.
Superconductors have been discovered in various metal elements and compound crystals. In 1986,
a cuprate superconductor with a superconducting critical temperature, Tc, over 40 K was found.1,2
In 2015, a hydride of H2S was shown to demonstrate Tc  203 K at a pressure of 155 GPa.
3
In
2023, a Tc of 294 K at 10 kbar was measured on a nitrogen-doped lutetium hydride;
4 moreover, a
superconductor [LK-99®] of over Tc=300K was successfully synthesized (language: Korean).
5
2
BCS(Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer) theory, which provides a microscopic explanation of
superconductivity, was introduced in 1957.
6 The Brinkman-Rice(BR)-BCS theory accounting for
Tc of over room temperature was discovered in 2021.7 Moreover, in 2021, a theory was published
that predicts Tc as approximately 10% of Fermi temperature.8
In addition, whether the pairing
symmetry of the superconducting energy gap in cuprate superconductors is d-wave or s-wave has
been debated for over 30 years; recent studies suggest that it may lean towards s-wave
symmetry.
9,10,11
To discover a room-temperature superconductor, observing the emergence of a metallic phase
through an insulator-to-metal transition (IMT) at temperatures higher than room temperature is
crucial.
12,13 Moreover, to explain this phenomenon, the discovery of a new material that exhibits
room-temperature superconductivity at atmospheric pressure, along with a comprehensive
mechanism, is required.
In this paper, we present a synthesis method for a Cu-doped lead apatite (LA) superconductor with
a Tc exceeding room temperature. We conduct levitation experiments and analyze the zero
resistance properties of the material. Moreover, we unveil the mechanism by which the metal phase
is formed through an insulator-to-metal transition (IMT) without undergoing a structural phase
transition in LA. Furthermore, we provide a phase diagram for the superconductor. Finally, we
briefly discuss the mechanism of room-temperature superconductivity based on the BR-BCS
theory7

II. RESULTS and DISCUSSIONS
A. LK-99®
: Synthesis
For sample manufacture, we synthesized Pb10-xCux(PO4)6O (0.9<x<1.1), known as LK-99®, using
the solid-state method. The raw materials used in the synthesis were PbO (Junsei, GR), PbSO4
(Kanto, GR), Cu (Daejung, EP), and P (Junsei, EP).
5 The solid-state method is explained in Fig. 1.
The process of sample synthesis comprises three steps. Step 1: To obtain Lanarkite Pb2(SO4)O =
PbO + Pb(SO4), PbO and Pb(SO4) powders were uniformly mixed in a ceramic crucible with a
rate of 50% each. The mixed powder was heated in a furnace at 725°C for 24 hours in the presence
of air [Fig. 1(b)]. During the heating process, the mixed materials underwent a chemical reaction, 
3
yielding lanarkite. Step 2: To synthesize Cu3P, Cu and P powders were mixed in a crucible as per
each component rate. The mixed powder was sealed in a crystal tube of 20 cm per gram with a
vacuum of 10-3
torr [Fig. 1(a)]. The sealed tube containing the mixed materials was heated in a
furnace at 550°C for 48 hours [Fig. 1(c)]. During this process, the mixed materials underwent a
transformation and formed Cu3P crystals. Step 3: The Lanarkite and the Cu3P crystals were ground
to make powder and mixed in a crucible. Then, the mixed powders were sealed in a crystal tube of
a vacuum of 10-3
torr [Fig. 1(a)]. The sealed tube containing the mixed powder was heated in a
furnace at 925°C for 5-20 hours [Fig. 1(d)]. During this process, the mixed powder reacted and
transformed into the final material of Pb10-xCux(PO4)6O. The sulfur element present in PbSO4 was
evaporated during the reaction. The various shapes observed during the process are depicted in
photos [Figs. 1(e-i)].

: Analysis of crystal structure
The manufactured powder’s crystallinity and structure were analyzed by X-ray diffraction (XRD)
measurements and data fitting. Fig. 2(a) shows a comparison of XRD data measured with LK-99®
sample 1 (over-doped material) and COD (Crystallography Open Database) data of the pure leadapatite supported by QualX software. The XRD analysis of the sample showed multiple black
peaks [Fig. 2(a)], indicating that it is a polycrystalline material. The XRD pattern of sample 1
closely matches that of modified-lead apatite (MLA) with slight peak shifts. However, the peak
indicated by symbol A in sample 1 is shifted to a larger angle, and a new peak, indicated by symbol
B, appears, suggesting a change in the lattice structure of sample 1, [Fig. 2(b)]. The shifts indicate
a decrease of lattice constant, which is interpreted as evidence of volume contraction. Comparing
the XRD pattern of sample 1 with MLA in the VESTA program confirms that sample 1 exhibits
an MLA structure, [Fig. 2(c)]. Specifically, an LA structure is formed as A10(BO4)C, one of the
frameworks of the hexagonal structure of element A.

Open Database. (b) Magnified pattern shows a peak shift and a new peak. (c) The XRD pattern is compared
with the modified apatite pattern obtained from BESTA program. It is closely fitted.
The XRD analysis reveals that sample 1 has a hexagonal structure of (P63/m, 176) with cell lattice
parameters of a=9.843 Å and c=7.428 Å [Figs. 3(a) and 3(b)], while the LA’s parameters are
a=9.865 Å and c=7.431 Å. The volume of sample 1 shrinks by 0.48%, resulting from substituting
Pb(M2) with Cu(M1). The phenomenon of shrinkage has already been studied in previous research
on apatite materials.
16 Although it is classified as an LA structure, Pb10(PO4)6O, is an insulator;
conversely, Cu-doped LA, Pb10-xCux(PO4)6O, is a superconductor at room temperature and a metal
above Tc. Moreover, it is structurally condensed by substituting M12+(corresponding to Pb12+
, at
Pb(1) position in LA atomic classification in crystallography information file, cif.) at the blackcolored position in Figs. 3(a) and 3(b) by Cu2+ ion (M22+, one reddish-brown-colored among four 
6
Pb(1) positions in Fig. 3(a)). Owing to the shrinkage, it becomes a superconductor.7 Further details
will be explained in a following section.

: Meissner effect
Figure 4(a) illustrates the temperature-dependent diamagnetic susceptibilities of zero-field cool 
7
(ZFC) and field cool (FC) in sample 2 (obtained in a quartz vessel with low doping of lead apatite)
and sample 3 (manufactured using higher-purity raw materials). The measurements were
conducted in a temperature range of -73.15℃(200K) to 126.85℃(400K) and involved the
observation of the Meissner effect, expelling the magnetic field. Fig. 4(b) shows the levitation
phenomenon measured at room temperature and atmospheric pressure for sample 4 (heat-treated
with sample 2), indicating the presence of a superconducting phase at room temperature and
atmospheric pressure, although the levitation is not perfect. The susceptibilities were measured for
samples 2 and 3 using MPMS-Evercool at Kaist Analysis center for Research Advancement.

D. LK-99®
: Resistivity
Figure 5 shows the temperature dependence of the resistivity of sample 2 (4.8  10.1  1.2mm)
measured at 30 mA by the four-probe method. A jump in resistivity appears near Tc=104.8℃
(377.95K). Above Tc, the linear characteristic of metal originating from the IMT is displayed.
Below Tc, three different behaviors are exhibited. In the first region below red-arrow C (near 60oC),
equivalent to region F in the inset of Fig. 5, the resistivity with noise signals can be regarded as
zero. In the second region, indicated by the red arrows C and D (near 90oC) and corresponding to
region G in the inset of Fig. 5, the resistivity of the sample monotonically increases with
temperature. This indicates the occurrence of resistance, suggesting a breakdown of the
superconducting energy gap as the temperature increases. At the third region between red-arrow
D and Tc, corresponding to region H in the inset of Fig. 5, the resistivity does not transparently
change with increasing temperature; however, d/dT fluctuates at the final stage of the breakdown
of the energy gap. In the first region, where signals resembling noise are observed, the zeroresistivity region is approximately 88% (333K/378K) of Tc under Kelvin units. This is
approximately three times larger than the typical value of about 30% observed in low Tc
superconductors. The presence of noise in the zero-resistivity region is often attributed to phonon
vibrations at higher temperatures, as indicated by region F in inset 5; the signals like noise were
directly measured5
. The presence of the zero-resistivity region is evidence of an s-wave
superconductor because a node-type superconductor with no-gap metal at node, such as dx2-y2
pairing symmetry has no zero-resistivity region due to increase of metal resistivity with increasing
temperature.오류! 책갈피가 정의되어 있지 않습니다.,오류! 책갈피가 정의되어 있지 않습니다.

density of states (DOS). The temperature dependence of d/dT is interpreted as that of DOS. Resistivity

: I-V characteristics
Figure 6(a) shows the temperature dependence of an I-V curve measured in sample 1. Above Tc,
the linear characteristic of a metal is displayed. As the temperature increases, Tc, current decreases.
Moreover, the magnitude of the jump of Tc, current decreases with increasing current. In particular,
at 105oC, the jump is very small. This indicates that the magnitude of the jump does not
monotonically decrease. This is known as exponential decrease in a gap-nogap transition
material.18 We conducted a detailed analysis of the current-voltage (I-V) curve below Tc, current,
measured at 25°C, focusing on the logarithmic y-axis. The curve can be divided into several
regions: I, J, K, L, M, and N. In regions I, J, and K, we observe an increase in resistance, indicating
the breaking of the superconducting energy gap due to Joule heating when the current exceeds a
certain threshold. The curve is obvious, as indicated by red-arrow O in an I-V curve measured at 
10
45oC. More high current of region L accelerates the breaking, which can be interpreted as an
avalanche region. At region M of much higher current, voltage does not almost change. This
indicates that the density of states (DOS)=dI/dV is constant near Tc, current, suggesting that the
pairing symmetry is s-wave, [Figs. 6(b) and 6(c)]. If the superconducting gap has a node, dI/dV
near Tc, current should increase.오류! 책갈피가 정의되어 있지 않습니다. After the jump, region N is a metal with
the linear Ohmic characteristic. The transition between the superconducting gap and the nogap
metal is the gap-nogap transition [Fig. 6(a)]. The transition is almost identical to the characteristic
of the IMT.19,20 Moreover, the fluctuation of regions I, J, and K, [Fig. 6(c)], is owing to temperature
inhomogeneity caused by Joule heat generated by both current and heat applied by the temperature
controller. Fig. 6(d) shows the magnetic field dependence of sample 1. Above the jump of Tc, the
I-V curve exhibits Ohmic characteristics, indicating a metallic behavior. As the magnetic field
increases, Tc, current, decreases, exhibiting the typical characteristic of a superconductor. Fig. 6(e)
exhibits a maximum Tc of 127oC in heat-treated sample 1. Because the jump remains, we deduce
that Tc exceeds 127oC. Above Tc, the linear characteristic of a metal is displayed. A summary of
the results is shown in the phase diagram [Fig. 7].

III. POSSIBLE MECHANISM OF SUPERCONDUCTIVITY
A. LK-99® : One-dimensional metal
The mother material of the LA structure, as shown in Fig. 3, is disassembled by the following
chemical formula,
Pb10(PO4)6O  [Pb14]
F
[Pb26]
T
(PO4)6O
= [Pb14(PO4)8/3]
F+ [Pb26(PO4)10/3O]T

T

F + [Pb23(PO4)(1+2/3)O1/2 + Pb23(PO4)(1+2/3)O1/2]
T
, ---- (1)
where F names the frame part and T denotes a part of the tunnel along the c-axis. This highly stable
structure consists of two layers of frames with an interior region.
21 , 22 , 23
 Formula (1) is
characterized by a one-dimensional bonding of Pb2 and O1/2 in the T part. When parts of the Pb1
(meaning the Pb(1) site in LA cif.) and the Pb2 (meaning the Pb(2) position in LA cif.) sites are 
13
randomly substituted by Cu2+ (3d9
) (one hole) elements, chemical formula of the Cu2+
-doped LA
structure is expressed as follows:
Pb10-xCux(PO4)6O = [Pb4-aCua(PO4)8/3]
F + [Pb6-bCub(PO4)10/3O]T
, where a+b=x
= [Pb4-aCua(PO4)8/3]
F + [Pb3-cCuc(PO4)5/3O1/2 + Pb3-cCuc(PO4)5/3O1/2]
T
, where c=b/2, a and b 0
= [Pb4-aCua(PO4)(2+2/3)]
F + [Pb3-cCuc(PO4)(1+2/3)O1/2 + Pb3-cCuc(PO4)(1+2/3)O1/2]
T
. ---- (2)
Hole doping quantities are determined as the outmost orbitals of -3a (=2(4-a)+(-1)a+(-3)(2+2/3))
in the frame part and -3c (=2(3-c)+(-1)c+(-3)(1+2/3)+(-2)(1/2)) in the T part. When IMT occurs
by Cu2+ doping, IMT is generated at both the F and the T parts. Generally, because an insulator
has a larger volume than that of a metal, the IMT is accompanied by a volume contraction without
the structural phase transition. The substitutions at the Pb1 sites, as indicated by the reddish-brown
color in Fig. 3(a), induce a volume contraction(1st) in the frame through the IMT(1st).16 Moreover,
substitutions at the Pb2 sites lead to an IMT(2nd) in the T part. The evidence of the volume
contraction is shown in Fig. 2(b). If the doping quantities of a and c in formula (2) differ, the extent
of the IMT and the magnitude of volume contraction may vary. If a>c, below a critical doping
level, the volume contraction(1st) in the frame may be larger than the volume contraction(2nd) in
the T part.
The outmost orbital of Pb is 6s2
6p2
. One electron in the 6p2
orbital of Pb2 is coupled to the O of
PbO, whereas the other contributes to the bonding of tetrahedral phosphate, PO4, [formulas (1) and
(2)]. Consequently, the inside structure is stabilized. Lone-pair electrons of 6s
2
in Pb play an
important role on the phase transition; the 6s
2
electrons are spherically symmetric and displaced
structure relative to the position of Pb atoms and contributing to polar interaction,.
23 Moreover,
Cu2+ can form a bond with one of lone-pair electrons of 6s
2
in Pb2, transforming the outmost
orbital of Pb2 to 6s
1
. Therefore, 𝑃𝑏1−𝑥
+2 𝐶𝑢𝑥
+2O ([2 electrons of 6s2
] + [one hole of 3d9
] = 6s
1
after
combining of electron and hole as polar interaction) at a Pb2 site acquires the electronic structure
of metal of half filling, 6s
1
. This is referred to as the hole-driven insulator-to-metal transition
(IMT).
19,20,24 Hence, Pb3(O1/2 = O1/4 + O1/4) structures are generated and the oxygen is located at
slightly higher or slightly lower position than Pb2, [blue balls in red dot box in Fig. 3(b)]. The
nearest two oxygens (blue balls) at the O1/4 position in O1/2 of 1-D channel, as shown in the red-
14
dot box of unit cell of Fig. 3b, are generally repulsive. In metal case, when one oxygen of the O1/4
vibrates (the distance between Pb2 and O1/4 expands and contracts), the other anti-vibrates (the
distance contracts and expands, respectively). This indicates that oxygen breathes; the distance
between Pb2and O1/4 is same. One unit cell has two Pb3O1/2 structures [Fig. 3(b)]. In the metal
state, the Pb2(6s
1
) carrier flows through the conduction band formed by Pb2−Pb2 and oxygens in
the Pb2 (in lower Pb3O1/2) −> O1/2 −> Pb2 (in higher Pb3O1/2) structure breath along c-axis, [Fig.
3(c)]. In the superconducting state, carriers of Pb2(6s
1
)s at nearest neighbor sites form a bi-polaron
in a superconducting bound state (VSuper potential = VCDW potential + Uc, critical on-site Coulomb energy), where
charge-density-wave state (CDW) has the structure of long and short distances in (Pb2-O1/4 or Pb2-
O1/2) between nearest neighbor Pb sites formed by breathing mode distortion (stopping breath)
between oxygens in the Pb3O1/2 structures). Then, the distance between Pb2and O1/4 differs, which
is the structural distortion and the on-site Coulomb interaction, U, between carriers in metal is
changed to Uc. The formation of the superconducting bound state is facilitated by the enhanced
on-site Coulomb repulsive interaction, resulting from both the structural contraction (1st) at the
frame of the LA induced by Cu2+ doping and the structural distortion accompanied by volume
contraction (2nd) owing to the temperature difference (∆T = TIMT - Tc) at Tc. These factors
contribute to superconducting condensation, as depicted in the phase diagram shown in Fig. 7.
7
The bi-polaron is able to tunnel through a barrier between two Pb3O1/2 structures in a onedimensional chain along the c-axis, where the Pb2 in the lower Pb3O1/2 is connected to O1/2 and to
Pb2 in the higher Pb3O1/2 (as shown in Figure 3(c)). Additionally, the first term of the frame part
in formula (2) can exhibit superconductivity owing to the IMT; however, because it is not onedimensional, its Tc will be much smaller compared to that of the T part in Formula (2). The
underlying reasons for this behavior will be further explained in the subsequent section.
B. LK-99®
: Strong correlation
As for a room-temperature-Tc mechanism, the MLA structure inducing the IMT is characterized
by volume contractions(1st and 2nd) by substituting Pb with Cu. A known theory to explain roomtemperature superconductivity, including structural volume contraction, is BR-BCS, suggesting
that divergence of the DOS, caused by on-site Coulomb repulsive interaction U increased by
volume contraction, increases superconducting Tc over room temperature in the BR-BCS Tc.

The BR-BCS theory uses a bi-polaron strongly coupled by the attractive charge-density-wave
potential (short-range electron-phonon interaction), instead of the Cooper pair defined as coupling
of excited two electrons bound by the attractive screened long-range electron-phonon (atom)
interaction.7,26 Moreover, the general mechanism of superconductivity in the Fermi system with
strong repulsive interaction explained in the 2D system that superconducting Tc reaches about 10%
of Fermi temperature (if TFermi  10,000 K is assumed),8
although this mechanism is not involved
in volume contraction. The theory of hole superconductivity suggested much higher Tc than that
proposed in BCS theory.24 In addition, one-dimensional superconductivity and Tc enhancement
were already disclosed.27,28,29,30
IV. CONCLUSION
We have successfully developed a method for synthesizing a superconducting material with an
MLA structure, exhibiting both one-dimensional characteristics and a Tc above room temperature
at atmospheric pressure. The presence of superconductivity was confirmed through observations
of the levitation phenomenon and analysis of zero resistivity. The unique features of the MLA
structure include volume contraction (1st) resulting from substituting Pb with Cu. On-site Coulomb
repulsive interaction increased by volume contractions(1st and 2nd) may cause the superconducting
phenomenon, as mentioned in the BR-BCS theory. Furthermore, the room-temperature 
16
superconductor opens up possibilities for high-performance superconducting wires and magnets
operating at room temperature, with potential applications in energy transmission, transportation,
and scientific research.
