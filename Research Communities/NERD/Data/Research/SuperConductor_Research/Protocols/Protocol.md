#superConductors 



Based on the findings of [[TwitterCrackRecipe]] and [[fullSineatrixPaper]], the following changes should be made to the [[Protocol]]:

Materials:
- PbO (Lead(II) oxide)
- PbSO4 (Lead(II) sulfate)
- Cu (Copper)
- P (Phosphorus)
- Ceramic crucible
- Crystal tube
- Furnace
- Isopropanol
- Silicate glue
- Silicon carbide

Procedure:

1. To obtain Lanarkite Pb2(SO4)O, mix PbO and Pb(SO4) powders uniformly in a ceramic crucible with a rate of 50% each. 

2. Heat the mixed powder in a furnace at 725°C for 24 hours in the presence of air. During the heating process, the mixed materials will undergo a chemical reaction, yielding lanarkite.

3. Wash the lanarkite with isopropanol and dry it.

4. To prepare the copper phosphide (Cu3P), layer copper beads over red phosphorus and heat it to 250 degrees under helium. This is a change from the original method of reacting copper with phosphorus at 500 degrees. 

5. Mix the lanarkite and copper phosphide in a 1:1 ratio. 

6. Place the mixture in a crystal tube and seal it with silicate glue. 

7. Heat the tube in a furnace at 400°C for 24 hours. 

8. After the heating process, cool the tube to room temperature. 

9. The product inside the tube is the desired superconductor. 

10. To test the superconductivity, place the product in a magnetic field. If the product is a superconductor, it will expel the magnetic field (Meissner effect).

Please note that this is a simplified version of the protocol and actual laboratory procedures may require additional steps and safety precautions.


## Protocol V1



Based on the information provided in the note, here is a protocol to replicate the findings of the paper:

Materials:
- PbO (Junsei, GR)
- PbSO4 (Kanto, GR)
- Cu (Daejung, EP)
- P (Junsei, EP)
- Ceramic crucible
- Crystal tube
- Furnace

Procedure:

1. To obtain Lanarkite Pb2(SO4)O, mix PbO and Pb(SO4) powders uniformly in a ceramic crucible with a rate of 50% each. 

2. Heat the mixed powder in a furnace at 725°C for 24 hours in the presence of air. During the heating process, the mixed materials will undergo a chemical reaction, yielding lanarkite.

3. To synthesize Cu3P, mix Cu and P powders in a crucible as per each component rate. 

4. Seal the mixed powder in a crystal tube of 20 cm per length under a vacuum and heat it at 650°C for 24 hours. This will yield Cu3P.

5. To synthesize Pb10-xCux(PO4)6O, mix the lanarkite and Cu3P powders uniformly in a ceramic crucible. 

6. Heat the mixed powder in a furnace at 800°C for 24 hours in the presence of air. The mixed materials will undergo a chemical reaction, yielding Pb10-xCux(PO4)6O.

7. After the heating process, cool the crucible to room temperature. The resulting material is Pb10-xCux(PO4)6O, which should exhibit superconductivity at room temperature.

8. To verify the superconductivity, perform magnetic susceptibility measurements. The material should exhibit a superconducting transition at room temperature.

Research Question:
Question:

"there's talk about oxigen being required to make superconductivity work. whats the most critical step at which oxygen would change the atomic configuration of the material?"


Based on the information provided in the note, the most critical step at which oxygen would change the atomic configuration of the material is during the synthesis of Pb10-xCux(PO4)6O. During this step, the lanarkite and Cu3P powders are heated in a furnace at 800°C for 24 hours in the presence of air. The oxygen in the air reacts with the other elements to form the superconducting material Pb10-xCux(PO4)6O. This step is critical because the amount of oxygen present can significantly affect the atomic configuration of the material and, consequently, its superconducting properties.
