## Play Protocol

1. Create Unique Notes: Use the Command Palette (Ctrl+P) to create unique notes in your knowledge graph vault. These notes will serve as the foundation for your DnD game.

2. Track the Lifecycle of the Question: Use the unique notes to track the lifecycle of the DnD game. Assign an ID number to each question or aspect of the game to easily reference and organize them.

3. Establish Game Mechanics: Define the game mechanics and rules for your DnD game. This can include character creation, combat rules, skill checks, and magic systems. Create separate notes for each aspect of the game mechanics and link them together using [[]] notation.

4. Create Characters and NPCs: Use the knowledge graph to create notes for each character and non-player character (NPC) in your DnD game. Include details such as their name, race, class, abilities, and backstory. Link these character notes to the relevant game mechanics notes.

5. Design the World: Create notes for different locations, cities, dungeons, and landmarks within your DnD world. Include descriptions, maps, and any relevant information about these locations. Link these world notes to the character and game mechanics notes.

6. Plan Quests and Adventures: Create notes for quests, adventures, and storylines within your DnD game. Include objectives, challenges, and rewards for each quest. Link these quest notes to the relevant character, world, and game mechanics notes.

7. Collaborate and Iterate: Encourage collaboration among players and Dungeon Masters (DMs) by allowing them to contribute to the knowledge graph. Players can add notes about their character's actions and decisions, while DMs can update the world and quest notes based on player interactions. Regularly review and iterate on the game based on player feedback and new ideas.

By using a collaborative knowledge graph, you can create a dynamic and interconnected framework for playing DnD. The knowledge graph allows for easy organization, tracking, and collaboration, enhancing the overall gaming experience.
