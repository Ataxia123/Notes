>-> Create Unique notes from the Command Pallete(Ctrl+P)
>-> These notes will allow us to track the lifecycle of the question and hopefully end up in the knowledge ðŸ§  bin
-> Use "[[]]" to create links to notes (they dont have to exist yet) and create an ID # using the unique title created
> -> Once the ID # has been created you can rename the note to a more descriptive title
>>[!notice] 
>>Unique Notes in our vault are the first step in the [[scientific method]] of the NerdBrain
