A Knowledge Graph is a knowledge base that uses a graph-structured data model or [[Topology]] to integrate data. It is often used to store interlinked descriptions of entities such as objects, events, situations, or abstract concepts, while also encoding the semantics underlying the used terminology. Knowledge Graphs are often associated with linked open data projects and are prominently used by search engines like Google, Bing, Yext, and Yahoo, as well as knowledge-engines and question-answering services like WolframAlpha, Siri, and Alexa, and social networks like LinkedIn and Facebook.

The term "Knowledge Graph" was coined as early as 1972 by Austrian linguist Edgar W. Schneider. Over the years, many knowledge graph representations have been developed, some of which are topic-specific. In 2012, Google introduced their Knowledge Graph, building on DBpedia and Freebase among other sources. Since then, several large multinationals have advertised their use of knowledge graphs, further popularizing the term.

Decentralized and distributed architectures for knowledge graphs refer to the ways in which the data in the knowledge graph is stored and managed.

In a [[decentralized architecture]], the data is spread across multiple nodes, each of which operates independently of the others. **Each node in a decentralized system has a copy of the knowledge graph and can operate and make decisions independently. This means that if one node fails, the others can continue to operate without interruption.** However, this can also lead to inconsistencies in the data, as changes made on one node may not be immediately reflected on the others.

On the other hand, in a [[distributed architecture]], the data is also spread across multiple nodes, **but these nodes work together as a single system. In this case, the knowledge graph is divided into parts, and each part is stored on a different node. This allows for greater scalability, as more nodes can be added to the system as the size of the knowledge graph grows.** However, this also means that if one node fails, it can affect the entire system, as each node relies on the others to function.
