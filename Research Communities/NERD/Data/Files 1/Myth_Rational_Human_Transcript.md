Carlton: Hey Johnny, I’ve been looking all over for someone to trade my spears with. I’m really hungry and I need some bread. Do you want to trade my spears for some bread? Johnny: Nah bro I only have two apples and
I don’t want spears. Carlton: What about my two-disc Blu-Ray special
edition of the Incredibles with commentary from director Brad Bird? Maybe then I could trade your apples for some
bread. Johnny: Nah, no thanks, Blu Ray is a social
construct, and besides, I didn’t even like the sequel. What’s going on, you look really worn out? Carlton: Man, I’ve been stressed out whole
day tryna barter. First I tried old man Geoffrey, then I tried
Shanice the shaman, even hit up Maurice from across the river. Just, no one. Johnny: I see what you mean, you seem down
badder than a lone antelope on an empty plain. This whole system feels rigged frfr. Carlton: Facts, I wish we didn’t have to
do things this way. Like, we all living together in a community. Why does everything have to be this rational,
calculating exchange to seek material advantage? Why can’t we just share our stuff? Johnny: Yeah but this is just the way it is,
the way it’s always been. Not like it’s ever gonna change. This is the only possible system. Carlton: I hate being the projection of dead
economists used to justify the universal and masturbatory nature of capitalism
Johnny: Same here. Good luck getting your bread though
