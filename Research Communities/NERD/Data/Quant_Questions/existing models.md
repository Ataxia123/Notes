As a Quant Analyst at a leading hedge fund, when considering existing models or frameworks for token grading and performance prediction, we primarily focus on a combination of quantitative and qualitative factors. 
Quantitatively, we use statistical models to analyze historical price data, trading volumes, market capitalization, and volatility. We also consider the token's liquidity, as it plays a crucial role in our ability to execute trades efficiently. 
Qualitatively, we assess the underlying technology of the token, the strength and credibility of the team behind it, the token's use case, and its competitive positioning in the market. 
One of the most commonly used models in our field is the Sharpe Ratio, which measures the performance of an investment compared to a risk-free asset, after adjusting for its risk. It's a useful tool to understand the return of an investment compared to its risk. 
Another model we often use is the Sortino Ratio, which differentiates harmful volatility from total overall volatility by using the asset's standard deviation of negative portfolio returns—downside deviation—instead of the total standard deviation of portfolio returns. 
We also use Machine Learning algorithms to predict future price movements based on historical data. These models can be complex and require a deep understanding of both the financial markets and machine learning techniques.
However, it's important to note that while these models can be helpful, they are not foolproof. Cryptocurrency markets are highly volatile and can be influenced by a wide range of factors that are difficult to predict. Therefore, any grading or prediction should be used as a guide rather than a definitive forecast. 
In conclusion, while there are several existing models for token grading and performance prediction, their effectiveness can vary greatly depending on the specific circumstances. It's crucial to use a combination of different models and to continually reassess and adjust our strategies as market conditions change.
