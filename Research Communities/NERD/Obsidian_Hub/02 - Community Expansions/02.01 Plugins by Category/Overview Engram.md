## Overview

Neuroscience acknowledges the existence of many types of memory and their physical location within the brain is likely to be dependent on the respective system mediating the encoding of this memory.[[9]](#cite_note-Gerrig_and_Zimbardo_2005-9) Such brain parts as the [cerebellum](/wiki/Cerebellum "Cerebellum"), [striatum](/wiki/Striatum "Striatum"), [cerebral cortex](/wiki/Cerebral_cortex "Cerebral cortex"), [hippocampus](/wiki/Hippocampus "Hippocampus"), and [amygdala](/wiki/Amygdala "Amygdala") are thought to play an important role in memory. For example, the hippocampus is believed to be involved in [spatial](/wiki/Spatial_memory "Spatial memory") and [declarative memory](/wiki/Explicit_memory "Explicit memory"), as well as consolidating short-term into long-term memory.

Studies have shown that declarative memories move between the limbic system, deep within the brain, and the outer, cortical regions. These are distinct from the mechanisms of the more primitive cerebellum, which dominates in the blinking response and receives the input of auditory information directly. It does not need to "reach out" to other brain structures for assistance in forming some memories of simple association.

An [MIT](/wiki/Massachusetts_Institute_of_Technology "Massachusetts Institute of Technology") study found that behavior based on high-level cognition, such as the expression of a specific memory, can be generated in a mammal by highly specific physical activation of a specific small subpopulation of brain cells. By reactivating these cells by physical means in mice, such as shining light on neurons affected by [optogenetics](/wiki/Optogenetics "Optogenetics"), a long-term fear-related memory appears to be recalled.[[10]](#cite_note-10)

Another study used [optogenetics](/wiki/Optogenetics "Optogenetics") and [chemogenetics](/wiki/Chemogenetics "Chemogenetics") to control neuronal activity in animals encoding and recalling the memory of a spatial context to investigate how the brain determines the lifetime of memories. The results found by the researchers have defined a role for specific hippocampal inhibitory cells ([somatostatin](/wiki/Somatostatin "Somatostatin") expressing cells) in restricting the number of neurons involved in the storage of spatial information and limiting the duration of the associated memory.[[11]](#cite_note-11)

In 2016, an MIT study found that memory loss in early stages of [Alzheimer's disease](/wiki/Alzheimer%27s_disease "Alzheimer's disease") could be reversed by strengthening specific memory engram cell connections in the brains of Alzheimer mouse models.[[12]](#cite_note-12)
