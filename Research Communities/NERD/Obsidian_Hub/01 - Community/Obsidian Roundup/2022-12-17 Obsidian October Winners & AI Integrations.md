## Obsidian Updates

* [v1.1.3](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/obsidian-release-v1-1-3-insider-build/49288) had a bunch of Canvas improvements, and Live Preview mode should no longer flash with unstyled text while scrolling big documents.
* [v1.1.4](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/obsidian-release-v1-1-4-insider-build/49532) also improved Canvas, but the main thing is that you can now "Group" things on your Canvas; they work a bit like placemats.
* [v1.1.5](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/obsidian-release-v1-1-5-insider-build/49696) also improved Canvas (are you sensing a theme), with more options and better rendering when zoomed out.
* [v1.1.6](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/obsidian-release-v1-1-6-insider-build/49871) _also_ improved Canvas, making it easier to export the canvas as an image.
