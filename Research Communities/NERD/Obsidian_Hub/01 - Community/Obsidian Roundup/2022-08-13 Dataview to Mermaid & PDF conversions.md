# 2022-08-13: Dataview to Mermaid & PDF conversions
Sync highlights and annotations from Raindrop & execute codeblocks interactively, a la Jupyter.

## Obsidian Updates

* Obsidian Mobile v1.3.1 is available for testing [on Android](https://discord.com/channels/686053708261228577/817515900349448202/1006609288988463144) and iOS. It includes fixes up till v0.15.9 of Obsidian Desktop.

## Plugin News

* Marcus Olsson [teased a preview](https://discord.com/channels/686053708261228577/840286264964022302/1005826839337521272) of a plugin that does calendar, kanban, and table views together. It currently uses its own data storage format but looks very exciting!

### Updates

_If you want a more comprehensive list of what plugins updated this week, check out [this plugin updates index](https://obsidian-plugin-stats.vercel.app/updates) by Ganessh Kumar._

### Pending

_Note: Not all new plugins are available in the community list yet, as they need to go through code review first. You can manually install plugins that aren't in the community list yet by using the [Beta Reviewer's Auto-update Tool (BRAT)](https://github.com/TfTHacker/obsidian43-brat). Note, though, that this is not as safe as waiting for them to go through code review._

* [Obsidian Keyboard Shortcuts](https://github.com/aciq/obsidian-keyboard-shortcuts) by `@aciq` is a plugin that covers the author's most used shortcuts. There seems to be some overlap with the other plugins but there are a few unique ones as well.

## Feature Requests

* There was [a request](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/fully-visual-editor-mode-wysiwyg/41517/5) for Obsidian to have a fully WSIWYG mode akin to Word or Google Docs.
* A user [requested](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/hovering-over-the-heading-of-a-note-and-a-pop-up-appears-that-shows-the-notes-title/41670) for showing the full note title on hovering over the title bar, in case the title has been truncated.
* There was [a request](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/embed-pdf-files-with-range-options/41677) for being able to embed page ranges from a PDF.
* A user is [looking for a way](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/obsidian-notes-kindle-workflow/41748) to push Obsidian notes to the Kindle for easier reading.
* Another user on the forum is [looking for a plugin](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/linked-pane-based-on-metadata/41741) to make a pinned sidebar display a workflow tied to the currently active note based on its metadata. The current solution involves manually changing and pinning the sidebar, which is quite tedious.

## Appearance

* `@jdanielmourao`'s Sanctum theme got [a round of fixes and tweaks](https://discord.com/channels/686053708261228577/855181471643861002/1006264635298681012) for Obsidian v0.15.9.
* `@SlRvb` also [released](https://discord.com/channels/686053708261228577/855181471643861002/1007438472652538018) several improvements for the ITS theme, including a neat tweak to display Dataview lists as columns.
* [Fusion](https://github.com/zamsyt/obsidian-fusion) by `@zamsyt` is a new theme that aims to remove background color variations for the default theme.
* [Here's](https://discord.com/channels/686053708261228577/702656734631821413/1003776341843394622) a CSS snippet that fixes the misaligned calendar dots.
* [Here's](https://discord.com/channels/686053708261228577/702656734631821413/1007048772754350080) another CSS snippet for smooth header transforms in Live Preview.

## Ancillary Code

* A Discord user [made a Dataview to Mermaid converter](https://discord.com/channels/686053708261228577/840286238928797736/1005354556135321650) where you can dynamically type in a query and it gets rendered as a Mermaid chart/diagram.

## Guides

* An AI researcher [shared their note-taking workflow](https://discord.com/channels/686053708261228577/722584061087842365/1003653163334778881), with the added note that they have ADHD. They mention how they wanted a very smooth and optimized flow for getting work done.
* A Reddit user [posted a guide](https://old.reddit.com/r/ObsidianMD/comments/whjm1w/guide_using_git_to_sync_your_obsidian_vault_on/) on how to set up Git sync on Android.

## Discussions

* There was [another discussion on Reddit](https://old.reddit.com/r/ObsidianMD/comments/wk3t9n/is_it_a_risk_to_rely_too_much_on_plugins/) on the longevity of Obsidian and using too many plugins.

## Housekeeping

* I'm about to head to the airport; expect me back on Discord and Twitter tomorrow. Georgia was fun but I miss everyone. Thanks `@ab1908` for pinch hitting with the writing of this :)
