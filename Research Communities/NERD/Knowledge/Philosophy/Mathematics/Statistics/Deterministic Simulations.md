Deterministic simulations use a variety of algorithms depending on the nature of the problem being solved. Here are some commonly used ones:

1. **Finite Difference Method (FDM)**: This is a numerical method for solving differential equations by approximating them with difference equations. It's often used in heat transfer, fluid dynamics, and other physical simulations.

2. **Finite Element Method (FEM)**: This is another numerical technique for solving problems of engineering and mathematical physics. Useful for problems with complicated geometries, loadings, and material properties where analytical solutions can not be obtained.

3. **Runge-Kutta Methods**: These are used for the numerical solution of ordinary differential equations. They are particularly useful when precision is important, as in the simulation of spacecraft trajectories.

4. **Molecular Dynamics (MD)**: This is a type of deterministic simulation used to model atomic and molecular interaction. It's used in physics, chemistry, and biology to study the physical movements of atoms and molecules.

5. **Discrete Event Simulation (DES)**: This is used to model systems where events occur at specific points in time. Examples include simulations of computer networks, logistics, and operational processes.

6. **Monte Carlo Methods**: While often associated with stochastic simulations, Monte Carlo methods can also be used in a deterministic sense to approximate the solution to numerical problems using random sampling.

7. **Lattice Boltzmann Methods (LBM)**: These are used in computational fluid dynamics to simulate the flow of fluids.

8. **Navier-Stokes Equations**: These equations describe the motion of fluid substances and are used in deterministic simulations of fluid dynamics.

Remember, the choice of algorithm depends heavily on the specific problem being solved, the required precision, and the computational resources available.
