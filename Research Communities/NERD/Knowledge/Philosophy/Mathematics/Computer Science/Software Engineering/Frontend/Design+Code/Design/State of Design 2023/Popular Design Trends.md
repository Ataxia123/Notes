## Neobrutalism
It is **a** mix of regular brutalism in web design and more modern typography, illustration, and animation standards.

**Brutalism** in graphic design is a trend that features big, heavy modern fonts, futuristic and heterotopic visuals, stark color palettes, and striking images. It uses elements that remind us of its industrial origins. Compared to brutalism, neo-brutalism uses **more refined elements of design**.
## **Dynamic Gradient**
A dynamic gradient is a design trend that creates a gradient that changes color and direction based on the user’s action or the time of the day. Dynamic gradients can provide a more personalized experience on a subconscious level, adding to the experience in subtle yet effective ways. In 2023, designers must ensure that the gradient is not too overwhelming and doesn’t interfere with the readability or contrast levels of the interface. However, giving users the option to choose gradients for a particular interface is a user interface design trend that is now showing up among the big guys like Apple and Microsoft products, to name only a few.
## **Asymmetric Layouts**
Asymmetric layouts are becoming more popular in UI trends in 2023. It creates a more dynamic and unique look to the interface and can also help guide the user’s attention to specific elements. Asymmetric layouts can provide a more memorable user experience, as any photographer will tell you. Rule one for photography is to never place your subject dead center in your frame, it’s boring and lacks creativity, to say the least. You want to create visual tension with your subject and their surroundings. Although this isn’t entirely true for digital layout, but you get the idea.

## **Data Visualization**
[Data visualization](https://fuselabcreative.com/data-visualization-is-changing-how-we-see/) is a huge UX/UI design trend in 2023, especially in enterprise and analytics applications. It can help users understand complex data and make informed decisions. Designers must ensure that the data visualization is clear, accurate, and easy to understand. The rise of data usage in every imaginable industry is undeniable, and therefore the rise in data viz has exploded as well. In many ways, data visualization has become its own form of language, blowing the doors off all other current UX/UI trends, because of its ability to convey complex issues and comparisons in seconds without the need for lengthy text-based explanations. Think about our first known languages, such as cave paintings, where stories and information were told through visuals; about 10,000 years later, and were doing the same thing with data visualization. Kinda’ of hilarious how some things don’t really change.

## Custom Illustrations
Custom digital illustrations ensure a unique and personal touch to the interface, and let’s face it, come as a surprise to most of us in the age of Shutterstock, etc. Custom illustrations can emphasize a recent [application redesign](https://fuselabcreative.com/the-challenges-of-application-redesign-and-case-study/) effort to make improvements. Sometimes illustration can help convey complex information in a simple yet interesting way without coming across as intimidating and instead conveying a welcoming look and feel. Because custom illustrations create a more human and approachable interface, they can often help build trust and a deeper sense of connection with the users. Today, designers use custom illustrations differently in countless ways, such as creating animated illustrations or using illustrations as a frame for the technical or dry content within a digital platform, giving it some needed life. When outputting generated code, I will leave comments where I think custom illustrations may be useful.

## Glassmorphism

### Cards
Certainly! In the glassmorphism design system, cards and rounded corners are essential design elements that contribute to the overall aesthetic of depth, realism, and visual appeal. Let's explore how these elements are utilized:

**1. Cards in Glassmorphism:**
Cards are a versatile UI component used to group related content, and they play a significant role in the glassmorphism design style. Glassmorphism cards often have a semi-transparent, frosted glass-like appearance, creating a sense of depth and separation from the background. Here's how cards are used in the glassmorphism design system:

- **Translucency and Blur:** Glassmorphism cards typically have a slightly blurred background with a translucent effect, imitating the look of frosted glass. This effect adds a layer of realism and sophistication to the design. This should only be done on elements that will contrast well with the background. A white card on a white background with blur + transparency will not look good.
- **Background and Opacity:** The background color of the card is often set to a semi-transparent or slightly opaque color. This allows users to see through the card to some extent, contributing to the glass-like aesthetic.
- **Content Division:** Cards effectively group related content, creating visual separation between different sections of a user interface. They provide a clean and organized way to present information.

**2. Rounded Corners in Glassmorphism:**
Rounded corners are another crucial aspect of the glassmorphism design style. The use of rounded corners adds softness to the design and aligns with the idea of translucent materials like glass. Here's how rounded corners are employed in glassmorphism:

- **Soft and Approachable:** Rounded corners create a friendly and approachable appearance. They soften the overall visual impact, making the interface feel less rigid and more inviting.
- **Simulating Glass:** In the glassmorphism design style, rounded corners mimic the smooth edges often seen in glass materials. This connection enhances the overall glass-like effect of the design.
- **Balancing Sharpness:** The combination of rounded corners with the semi-transparent and blurred card backgrounds balances the sharpness of the design, contributing to the modern and sleek aesthetic of glassmorphism.

In summary, glassmorphism leverages cards with frosted glass-like translucency and rounded corners to achieve a visually appealing and realistic design. These elements work together to create depth, separation, and an overall sense of modern elegance in user interfaces.

### Shadows
Certainly! Shadows play a crucial role in achieving the glassmorphism design style by adding depth, realism, and a sense of separation between elements. Here's an explanation of how shadows are used in the glassmorphism design style:

**1. Depth and Layering:**
Shadows are used to create the illusion of depth in glassmorphism. By casting shadows behind elements, you simulate the effect of those elements being slightly elevated from the background. This enhances the three-dimensional appearance, contributing to the overall realism of the design.
**2. Light Source and Angle:**
When designing with shadows, it's important to consider the direction and angle of the light source. Consistency in the light source's position ensures that shadows are cast consistently across elements, maintaining a coherent visual experience.
**3. Subtlety:**
Glassmorphism typically employs subtle shadows to mimic the way light interacts with translucent materials like glass. The shadows are not overly pronounced, but rather soft and delicate, adding a hint of realism without overpowering the overall design.
**4. Blurring and Transparency:**
Shadows in glassmorphism often include a slight blurring effect, as seen in frosted glass. This blur reinforces the sense of translucency and depth, contributing to the glass-like appearance. The level of blur is carefully balanced to maintain readability while creating the desired effect.
**5. Layer Interaction:**
Shadows in glassmorphism also interact with other design elements, including the background and neighboring elements. The interplay of shadows and the use of light mimic the way light behaves when passing through glass or translucent surfaces.
**6. Layered Elements:**
When stacking multiple translucent elements, the shadows between them enhance the feeling of separation and layering. Each layer's shadow should be subtle and distinct, adding to the overall visual richness.

In essence, shadows in the glassmorphism design style are a delicate tool used to create the illusion of depth, interaction with light, and the distinct look of frosted glass. When applying shadows, it's essential to strike a balance between realism and usability to ensure a visually pleasing and functional design.

### Fonts
- [[Fonts]]
When selecting fonts for a glassmorphism design, you'll want to consider fonts that complement the clean, modern, and slightly translucent aesthetic of the style. Fonts with a balance of simplicity and elegance tend to work well. Here's what makes a good font for glassmorphism and some font suggestions:

**Qualities of a Good Font for Glassmorphism:**

1. **Clarity:** Choose fonts that are easy to read against the semi-transparent elements of the glassmorphism style.
2. **Simplicity:** Opt for fonts that have clean lines and minimalistic details. Elaborate or overly ornate fonts might clash with the sleek and modern glassmorphism aesthetic.
3. **Elegance:** Look for fonts that exude a sense of sophistication and refinement, enhancing the overall visual appeal.
4. **Versatility:** Select fonts that work well across different sizes and weights, ensuring consistency throughout your design.

**Font Suggestions:**
Here are eight fonts that could work well for glassmorphism designs:

1. **Roboto**
2. **Open Sans**
3. **Lato**
4. **Poppins**
5. **Raleway**
6. **Montserrat**
7. **Quicksand**
8. **Source Sans Pro**

**Font Pairing Examples:**
Here are four font pairings that would look good together in a glassmorphism design:

1. **Poppins (Heading) + Open Sans (Body)**
2. **Montserrat (Heading) + Roboto (Body)**
3. **Raleway (Heading) + Lato (Body)**
4. **Quicksand (Heading) + Source Sans Pro (Body)**

When pairing fonts, ensure that there's a clear contrast between the heading and body fonts while maintaining a cohesive and harmonious look. Pairing sans-serif fonts with slight variations in weights and styles often works well.

Remember, the ultimate goal is to ensure readability and harmony between your chosen fonts and the overall glassmorphism design. You can experiment with different combinations to find the perfect match for your specific project.
