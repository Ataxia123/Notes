[[Stimulants101]]

In [[pharmacology]], stimulants are a class of drugs that speed up the messages between the brain and the body. They can increase a person's attention, alertness, and energy levels. Stimulants work by enhancing the effects of certain [[neurotransmitters]] in the [[brain]], such as [[dopamine]] and [[norepinephrine]].

Stimulants can be prescribed by doctors to treat conditions like attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ([[ADHD]]), [[narcolepsy]], and in some cases, [[depression]]. However, some stimulants have high potential for misuse and [[addiction]], including illicit drugs like [[cocaine]] and [[methamphetamine]], and prescription medications like [[Adderall]] and [[Ritalin]].

[[Effects of stimulants]] can include increased heart rate and blood pressure, elevated mood, increased energy, and decreased appetite. Long-term misuse can lead to serious health problems like heart disease, seizures, and mental health disorders.
