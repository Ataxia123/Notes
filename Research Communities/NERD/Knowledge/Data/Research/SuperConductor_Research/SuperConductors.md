## General Info about LK-99

**" The purported properties of the material labeled “LK-99” are incredible. Originally synthesised in 1999, not only is it RTP, but the critical temperature is actually 127°C – above the boiling temperature of water. "**

The synthesis method is also shockingly simple: [[Protocol]]

**Finely grind and mix Lanarkite (Pb2(SO4)O) and Copper Phosphide (Cu3P) and bake it at 925°C in a vacuum chamber for a day.** 

The ability to discover and synthesise it has theoretically been available since the industrial revolution. Now, one should be able to do it in a garage or home lab.

The note titled [[fullPaper]] is a detailed scientific paper on the synthesis and analysis of a superconducting material with a modified-lead apatite (MLA) structure, specifically Pb10-xCux(PO4)6O, also known as LK-99®. The material exhibits superconductivity at room temperature and atmospheric pressure, a significant achievement in the field of superconductivity.

## Current research findings:


The key findings from the [[TwitterCrackRecipe]] notes are as follows:

1. The user, Iris, is working on a superconductor experiment, specifically focusing on one-dimensional superconductors. This is a significant area of research as 1D systems have kinetic energy of heat 3-6 times lower than in 3D systems, making them potentially more efficient.

2. Iris is using a combination of lanarkite, copper (I) phosphide, and other materials to create a superconductor. She criticizes the original method of obtaining lanarkite and copper (I) phosphide, suggesting more efficient alternatives.

3. Iris emphasizes the importance of removing evaporating sulfur in the process, criticizing the original method for sealing it in a glass ampoule with the product. She suggests that sulfur evaporating is a thermodynamic driver of the process and should not be prevented from leaving.

4. Iris successfully obtained conductive samples of #LK99, a superconductor, but faced challenges in making an open ring out of it due to issues with the nickel crucible.

In terms of understanding the current key aspects of superconductors, the notes suggest the following:

1. The type of superconductor (1D vs 3D) can significantly impact its efficiency and potential applications.

2. The process of creating superconductors involves complex chemical reactions and precise conditions. Even small changes in the process, such as the method of obtaining materials or the removal of byproducts, can significantly impact the results.

3. The process of creating superconductors is still being refined and improved, with ongoing research and experimentation.


The paper [[FullPaper2]] presents the synthesis and analysis of a material called LK-99®, a modified-lead apatite crystal structure with the composition (Pb10-xCux(PO4)6O (0.9<x<1.1)). This material exhibits superconductivity at room temperature and atmospheric pressure, a phenomenon attributed to two factors: volume contraction resulting from an insulator-metal transition achieved by substituting Pb with Cu, and on-site repulsive Coulomb interaction enhanced by structural deformation. The superconducting critical temperature, Tc, of the LK-99® sample is above 126.85℃ (400K). 

The paper [[fullSineatrixPaper]] further investigates the properties of Cu-substituted lead phosphate apatite, identifying correlated isolated flat bands at the Fermi level, a common signature of high transition temperatures in established families of superconductors. The paper suggests that these isolated bands arise from a structural distortion induced by the Cu ions and a chiral charge density wave from the Pb lone pairs. The paper also proposes a minimal two-band model to explain the low-energy physics in this system.

When comparing the findings of both papers, it becomes clear that they complement each other. Both papers highlight the significance of Cu substitution in the lead phosphate apatite structure, leading to the emergence of superconductivity at room temperature. The structural distortion and the role of Pb's lone pairs, as discussed in [[fullSineatrixPaper]], provide a deeper understanding of the phenomena observed in [[FullPaper2]]. 

In summary, the findings from both papers contribute to the understanding of high-temperature superconductivity in Cu-substituted lead phosphate apatite, opening up potential avenues for the development of new superconducting materials.

## Key Findings of Sinead Paper

Based on your notes, the key findings of the paper titled "Origin of correlated isolated flat bands in copper-substitified lead phosphate apatite" by Sinéad M. Griffin are as follows:

1. The author identifies the origins of isolated flat bands at the Fermi level, a common signature of high transition temperatures in established superconductors, as arising from a structural distortion induced by the Cu ions and a chiral charge density wave from the Pb lone pairs.
2. The results suggest that a minimal two-band model can encompass much of the low-energy physics in this system.
3. The implications of the results on possible superconductivity in Cu-doped apatite are discussed.
4. The role of stereochemically active 6s2 lone pairs of Pb in the formation of the flat bands is explored. The author suggests that the lone pairs could be responsible for the structural distortion observed in the material.
5. The author also explores the potential of other materials with similar structures to exhibit superconductivity, opening up a new avenue for the discovery of high-temperature superconductors.
6. The paper concludes with a discussion on future work, which includes further experimental and theoretical studies to confirm the predictions made in the paper.

Key highlights from the paper include:

1. Synthesis: The material was synthesized using the solid-state method. The process involved three steps, including the creation of Lanarkite, the synthesis of Cu3P, and the final transformation into Pb10-xCux(PO4)6O.

2. Analysis: The structure and crystallinity of the synthesized material were analyzed using X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements. The analysis revealed that the material has a hexagonal structure and exhibits volume contraction due to the substitution of Pb with Cu.

3. Superconductivity: The superconducting properties of the material were analyzed using magnetic susceptibility measurements. The material exhibited a superconducting transition at room temperature, which is a significant achievement as most superconductors only exhibit this property at extremely low temperatures.

4. Theoretical Analysis: The paper also includes a theoretical analysis of the superconducting mechanism of the material. It proposes that the superconductivity is due to the formation of Cooper pairs in the CuO planes of the material.

5. Future Work: The paper concludes with a discussion on future work, which includes optimizing the synthesis process to improve the superconducting properties of the material and exploring its potential applications in various fields such as energy transmission and quantum computing.

The most notable aspect of the paper is the discovery of room-temperature superconductivity in the synthesized material, which could have far-reaching implications in the field of superconductivity.

## The Role of Blockchain


Blockchain technology could be instrumental in achieving the goals of the #superConductor project in several ways:

**Data Integrity and Traceability:** Blockchain's immutable and transparent nature ensures that all data related to the project, such as experimental results and changes in the synthesis process, are recorded and can be traced back. This could help maintain the integrity of the data and allow for easy replication of the results.

**Collaboration:** Blockchain could facilitate collaboration by creating a decentralized platform where researchers from around the world can contribute to the project. They could share their findings, propose new ideas, and collectively make decisions, all in a transparent and secure manner.

**Intellectual Property Protection:** Blockchain could be used to timestamp and record all contributions to the project, providing a clear record of who contributed what and when. This could help protect intellectual property rights and resolve any disputes that may arise.

Fundraising: Blockchain could facilitate fundraising through the creation of a project-specific cryptocurrency or token. Supporters of the project could purchase these tokens, providing the necessary funds for the project. The tokens could also be used to incentivize contributions to the project.

**Resource Allocation:** Blockchain could be used to create smart contracts that automatically allocate resources based on predefined rules. For example, a smart contract could automatically release funds for a particular task once it has been completed and verified.

**Open Science:** Blockchain could facilitate open science by creating a public, decentralized database of scientific research. This could increase the accessibility and transparency of scientific research, and allow for the collective advancement of knowledge.

**By integrating blockchain technology into the #superConductor project, it could help streamline the project management, facilitate collaboration, protect intellectual property, and promote open science.**
