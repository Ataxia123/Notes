Creating a framework to implement the scientific method using the information from the SM_Wikipedia note can be a valuable tool for conducting research and problem-solving. Here are some steps you can follow to create such a framework:

>[!cue] #Question Define the problem: 

Clearly identify the problem or question you want to address. This will serve as the starting point for your research.

This section is the foundation of your research project. It's where you define the problem or question you want to answer. A good research question should be clear, focused, concise, complex, and arguable.

- **Clear:** It should be simple enough to understand, but complex enough to warrant a detailed answer.
- **Focused:** It should be narrow enough to be answered thoroughly in the space you have.
- **Concise:** It should be as brief as possible while still clearly conveying what you want to investigate.
- **Complex:** It should not be answerable with a simple "yes" or "no." Instead, it should require you to provide evidence or reasoning.
- **Arguable:** There should be more than one potential answer or point of view.

In this section, you should also explain why your question is important and how it contributes to the field of study. You may also want to include any sub-questions that will help you answer your main research question.

>[!cue] #Research Build a Knowledge Base: 

-> Using the question as a guiding light, start aggregating and relating information to create a  [[wiki]] using research notes.

This section is where you gather information and evidence to answer your research question. This involves conducting a literature review, which is an examination of scholarly materials related to your research question.

The purpose of the literature review is to **identify what has already been written on the topic, who the key researchers are, what theories exist, and what questions are being asked.** This will help you understand the broader context of your research and ensure that you're not duplicating previous research.

In addition to reviewing existing literature, your research may also involve conducting experiments, surveys, interviews, or other forms of data collection.

In this section, you should document your research process, including where and how you searched for information, what criteria you used to select your sources, and how you analyzed the data you collected. You should also discuss any obstacles you encountered and how you overcame them.

Finally, this section should include a summary of the findings from your research. 

>[!notice]
This should be a factual, unbiased report of the results, without any interpretation or opinion. Your interpretation of the results will come later, in the 'Analysis' section.


>[!cue] #Hypothesis Challenge the unknown.

>Based on your understanding of the problem, develop a hypothesis that provides a possible explanation or solution. The hypothesis should be testable and falsifiable.

Creating a hypothesis is a critical step in the scientific method. It is a tentative explanation for an observation, phenomenon, or scientific problem that can be tested by further investigation. Here are some steps and best practices to create a strong hypothesis:

1. **Understanding the Problem:** Before you can propose a hypothesis, you need to have a clear understanding of the problem or question you are investigating. This involves thorough research and analysis of the existing literature and data related to the problem.
    
2. **Formulating the Hypothesis:** Based on your understanding of the problem, propose a hypothesis that provides a possible explanation or solution. The hypothesis should be a clear, concise, and testable statement. It should also be specific and include the variables you intend to manipulate and measure.
    
    - **Testable:** Your hypothesis should propose a relationship between two or more variables that can be tested through experimentation.
    - **Falsifiable:** Your hypothesis should be capable of being proven false. This is a fundamental principle of the scientific method.
3. **Predicting Outcomes:** A good hypothesis also includes a prediction about its verifiability. This prediction is often based on logic or evidence from previous studies.
    

## Best Practices

- **Simplicity:** Keep your hypothesis simple and to the point. It should be easy to understand and test.
- **Specificity:** Your hypothesis should be specific and focused. Avoid vague language and make sure it addresses your research question directly.
- **Consistency:** Your hypothesis should be consistent with what is already known about the topic. If your hypothesis contradicts well-established facts, it may need to be revised.
- **Use Conditional Phrasing:** Hypotheses are often expressed in the form of an "If...then..." statement. This helps to establish a cause and effect relationship between the variables.

>[!notice]
>Remember, a hypothesis is not a fact, but a proposed explanation for a phenomenon. It is meant to be tested and may be proven false. The goal is not to prove your hypothesis right, but to gain insights into the problem you are investigating.

>[!cue] #Experiment Prove your worth.

Design experiments or studies: Determine the appropriate methods and procedures to test your hypothesis. This may involve conducting experiments, collecting data, or analyzing existing data.

Collect and analyze data: Implement the experiments or studies and collect relevant data. Use appropriate statistical methods to analyze the data and draw conclusions.

Evaluate and refine: Evaluate the results of your experiments or studies and assess whether they support or refute your hypothesis. If necessary, refine your hypothesis and repeat the process. This is an iterative process and may require several rounds of testing and refinement.

## Best Practices


>[!note] Document your findings: 
>Document your process, findings, and conclusions in a clear and concise manner. This is where Obsidian's features can be particularly useful. Use the Cornell Notes system to structure your notes, with cues and summaries to highlight key points and findings.

>[!note] Share and collaborate: 
>Share your notes and findings with others in your distributed collective. This can be done directly through Obsidian, or by exporting your notes to a format that can be easily shared and viewed by others. Encourage feedback and collaboration to further refine your findings and conclusions.

>[!cue] Review and iterate: 
>Regularly review your notes and findings, and update them as necessary. The scientific method is an iterative process, and your understanding of a problem or phenomenon will likely evolve over time as you gather more data and insights.


>[!notice] 
>By following this framework, you can effectively use the scientific method to conduct research and solve problems in a systematic and organized manner. The features of Obsidian, such as the [[Research Communities/NERD/Procedures/templates/Cornell Notes]] system and [[Using Tufte Sidenotes in Obsidian | Tufte Sidenotes]], can greatly enhance this process by facilitating clear and effective note-taking and documentation.
