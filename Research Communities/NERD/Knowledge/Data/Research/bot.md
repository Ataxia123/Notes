>[!notice] Definition: 
>An Internet bot, web robot, robot or simply bot is a [[software_application]] that runs automated tasks ([[scripts]]) over the [[Internet]], usually with the intent to imitate [[Research Communities/NERD/Data 1/Research/human]] activity on the Internet, such as [[messaging]], on a large scale. An Internet bot plays the client role in a [[client–server model]] whereas the server role is usually played by web servers. Internet bots are able to perform tasks, that are simple and repetitive, much faster than a person could ever do. The most extensive use of bots is for [[Web_crawling]], in which an automated script fetches, analyzes and files information from web servers. More than half of all web traffic is generated by bots.[2]
