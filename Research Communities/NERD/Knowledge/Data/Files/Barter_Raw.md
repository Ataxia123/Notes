What anthropologists have observed is a system
of non-enumerated credits and debts. That means that people owe and are owed to,
but such obligations are not quantified or measured exactly, and while valuables are
given, there is no explicit agreement for immediate or future returns. Such gift economies rely on mutual and alternating
debts as the foundation upon which social relationships are maintained. There is still a sense of some gifts being
better than others, of course. Canoes take a lot of time and effort to make,
so you’re gonna get called cheap if the gift you return is just a chicken, but nobody’s
gonna assign a numerical value to exactly how cheap you are for that social faux pas. Across the world, we can find many examples
of gift economy principles practised in day-to-day life. In the Trobriand Islands of Papua New Guinea,
the people exchange shell necklaces and armbands (known as soulava) in a vast and complex network
of relationships that spans the islands. The soulava are considered valuable not for
their inherent worth, but for the relationships they help to create and maintain. In traditional Chinese society, gift-giving
was viewed as a way to build and maintain guanxi, the social connections and networks
that facilitate cooperation and trust among people. Among the Indigenous peoples of the Pacific
Northwest Coast of North America, the practice of potlatch served to create and reinforce
social relationships through gift-giving at large ceremonial feasts, to mark important
life events such as weddings, funerals, and the passing of leadership roles, and to demonstrate
one's wealth, generosity, and social status. Non-monetary societies typically separate
the things and services they share into various spheres of exchange. There might be a sphere of general consumption,
a sphere for land, a sphere for marriages, and a sphere for diplomacy. For example, some rural Mongolian gold miners
wouldn’t use the gold they mined to purchase cattle or pay dowries, because taking material
from one sphere and putting it into another is considered a pollution. Consolidating everything into one sphere of
exchange through money is not the only way of organising economic life. And anyway, there’s no reason why there
should be just one story for the origin of money. If money is just a mathematical system that
allows for the comparison of proportional values which may or may not take the form
of a circulating medium of exchange, then that could develop independently all over
the place. Current evidence demonstrates that widespread
pricing systems emerged in the Fertile Crescent as a side-effect of non-state bureaucracies. In ancient Mesopotamia, temple administrations
employed thousands of people which all needed to be fed and provisioned. This led to a system of fixed equivalences
between silver and grain, as silver was already being used to make images of gods and grain
was stockpiled within the temples as well. A single silver shekel was made equivalent
to the rationed number of bushels of barley that could provide two meals a day for a temple
worker over the course of a month. This fixed equivalence was then extended to
compare the values of other everyday items. Even then, however, this system of pricing
only created a means of keeping track of credit-based transactions, not the actual use of silver
currency. But temple bureaucracies are not that common. Another origin of money can be found in legal
bureaucracies. People who have been wronged tend to want
exact compensation. An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth. You kill my brother and you have to pay my
family x amount of cows or that amount of cows’ equivalent in silver. Societies that wanted to prevent minor grievances
from turning into major wars would develop elaborate systems of penalties for various
forms of injuries or slights, which required a means of precise compensation that wouldn’t
otherwise be necessary for ordinary informal credit arrangements or gift economies. Hence, money. The myth of the barter economy has had disastrous
results on our collective understanding of economic history. In societies without money throughout history,
gift-giving and credit systems formed the basis of social ties and economic relations
of mutual obligation, not atomised, individualistic, and self-interested spot transactions between
strangers. In such societies, where exchanges of goods
and services occurred, people were far more interested in who they loved, hated, wanted
to embarrass, wanted to bail out of troubles, and wanted to avoid fueds with than just trying
to get the best deal. The idea embedded within the barter myth is
that we can only operate with a sort of quid pro quo mentality a la Homo Economicus and
that money is simply an improved form of our existing baseline prehistoric relations. From there, it may be easy to assign value
not just to objects, but to people. The institution of money has enabled institutions
like chattel slavery and imperialism, and led to the development of capitalism, which
forces the majority of people to sell their time and labour for a wage in order to meet
their basic subsistence needs. The barter myth is a projection of a mindset
created under specific conditions to all of human nature, creating a narrow vision of
our range of economic and social possibilities. Our imaginations need not be so limited by
these common-sense economic mythologies. For much of human history, we have shared
our time, energy, and resources within our communities for the benefit of all. Some societies forged cross-community goodwill
through the sharing of gifts. I’ve already spoken about how we can reinvigorate
such relations in modern times through the development of library economies, but I intend
to explore the concept even further in the future. For now, all power to all 
the people. Peace.Back when I was in school, in my social studies
class, I learned that prior to the invention of money, people had to barter for everything
they needed from anyone else. In a barter system, value is determined by
negotiation and mutual agreement, not market price. So people negotiate with each other to trade
goods and services they can offer with goods and services they desire. So for example, let’s say I have baskets
pon baskets of mangoes and I’m tryna get rid of them because I prefer pineapples. And let’s say one of my neighbours, we’ll
call them Patsy, has a goat and my other neighbour, Boyo, has a field of pineapples. Boyo doh like mangoes, but he does want a
goat for a goat race, and Patsy tired taking care of this goat, so she ready to give away
the goat in exchange for some mangoes. Easy solution, I give Patsy my mangoes, I
get Patsy’s goat, and I give Patsy’s goat to Boyo in exchange for his pineapples. That’s the ideal barter system scenario,
but it gets messy the moment you introduce more than one trade scenario into the equation. What if Boyo didn’t want the goat, what
if he wanted a cow? What if Patsy was allergic to mangoes? What if none of my neighbours had pineapples
and my mangoes just rotted away cuz I couldn’t trade them for anything I wanted? That tricky scenario is known as the double
coincidence of wants problem, which is when two parties each have a good or service that
the other party wants, but they are unable to trade because they each desire something
different from what the other has to offer. It arises fairly frequently within barter
systems because you can’t always find someone who’s willing to trade what you have for
what you want. In my social studies textbook, the double
coincidence of wants problem was used to explain why people shifted from the barter system
to the monetary system. Money being the solution as it serves as a
standardised medium of exchange. But what if I told you that isn’t what happened? Let’s dive right into the debate on the
origins of money, the reality of pre-money exchange, the actual uses of barter through
history, and how all of this has affected our imagination of the present and the future. [TITLE CARD]
In his highly influential 18th-century work An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of The
Wealth of Nations, Scottish economist Adam Smith first proposed the idea that as soon
as a division of labour appeared in human society, such as some specialising in hunting
while others specialised in crafting, people would naturally begin to barter with each
other, leading to the double coincidence of wants problem that would give birth to money. Long prior to Adam Smith, Aristotle had also
theorised in his book Politics in the 4th century BCE that barter preceded the invention
of money. Carl Menger, Stanley Jevons, and other 19th-century
economists all kept Smith’s framework of barter preceding money. These days, every introduction to economics
seems to speculate that barter was the foundation of “simple, early economies.” One trending title on the history of money
charts its history from barter to banknotes to bitcoin. Meanwhile, in the world of science, anthropologists
were out in the field directly observing how economies without money actually worked. They noted a vast diversity in arrangements,
from societies where people competed to give the best gifts to societies that commonly
held stockpiles of goods. As British anthropologist Caroline Humphrey
concluded, “No example of a barter economy, pure and simple, has ever been described,
let alone the emergence from it of money; all available ethnography suggests that there
never has been such a thing.” Of course, barter has existed historically
and contemporarily, but it has never been the basis of a whole economy and it was not
the origin of money. Barter as a practice arises in three main
circumstances: the first is in situations where people are used to using money but don’t
have it anymore, such as in economic crises. In such cases, barter arises after the invention
of money. The second occurs on rare occasions between
strangers who will never see each other again, hardly the basis of a day-to-day economy. The third is where there are ongoing trade
relations between strangers in moneyless economies, but no double coincidence of wants problem
arises because they already know exactly what they want to acquire from the other party. If you’re going to cross a desert, a mountain,
and an ocean risking death to trade your goods, you’re doing so because you know they have
what you want and you have what they want. Even when money and markets did exist, they
would still trade based on conventional rates of exchange, or if money was used, it was
used for specific commodities. Being a merchant in ancient times was not
easy, so you make it a bit easier by minimising uncertainty. While it’s possible for such a system to
generate a means of accounting, there’s no reason to assume that it would produce
a concrete medium of exchange regularly used in everyday transactions within a society. Such a system would likely only be used by
the tiny proportion of the population engaged in long-distance trade. As the late British anthropologist David Graeber
argues, among the many flaws of this economic theory on the origin of money via barter is
the assumption of spot transactions as the basis of early economies: if people don’t
make the trade right away, there’s no deal. But why would we limit ourselves to spot transactions
in a day-to-day economy? If you don’t have what I want right now,
I can still give you what you want, and you’ll eventually return the favour. We are neighbours, after all. The vast majority of all economic relations
in human history have existed between people that lived near each other and knew each other
personally, not long-distance traders. An institution as impersonal as money wouldn’t
cut it in such contexts. [Skit: The Myth of the Rational Human]
Carlton: Hey Johnny, I’ve been looking all over for someone to trade my spears with. I’m really hungry and I need some bread. Do you want to trade my spears for some bread? Johnny: Nah bro I only have two apples and
I don’t want spears. Carlton: What about my two-disc Blu-Ray special
edition of the Incredibles with commentary from director Brad Bird? Maybe then I could trade your apples for some
bread. Johnny: Nah, no thanks, Blu Ray is a social
construct, and besides, I didn’t even like the sequel. What’s going on, you look really worn out? Carlton: Man, I’ve been stressed out whole
day tryna barter. First I tried old man Geoffrey, then I tried
Shanice the shaman, even hit up Maurice from across the river. Just, no one. Johnny: I see what you mean, you seem down
badder than a lone antelope on an empty plain. This whole system feels rigged frfr. Carlton: Facts, I wish we didn’t have to
do things this way. Like, we all living together in a community. Why does everything have to be this rational,
calculating exchange to seek material advantage? Why can’t we just share our stuff? Johnny: Yeah but this is just the way it is,
the way it’s always been. Not like it’s ever gonna change. This is the only possible system. Carlton: I hate being the projection of dead
economists used to justify the universal and masturbatory nature of capitalism
Johnny: Same here. Good luck getting your bread though. What anthropologists have observed is a system
