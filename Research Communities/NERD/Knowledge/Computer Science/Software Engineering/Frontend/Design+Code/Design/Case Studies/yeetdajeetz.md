# yeetdajeetz
This is a case study analyzing the design of a memecoin called "yeetdajeetz." The implication is that they're getting rid of (yeet) all of the jeetz (people who sell.)
### First Glance
The first thing you notice is the orange background. In the hero (top of the page,) on the right side you then see cards with a black background, white text, and a white border. These cards contain social links in a 2x2 grid (no icons, just text) and general info on the project above the social links. On the left side of the hero there's a graphic of Pepe the Frog throwing a McDonald's employee (tying back to the project title.) The design draws inspiration for Neobrutalism but is clearly not done by a professional. The font is a rounded font called "PrettyFontBold."

### Website Sections
- Hero
- Yeet contract interaction (press button to execute code on blockchain)
	- This is styled as a full-width card, rounded corners, black background.
	- Each stat is a white card, rounded corners, and contains a title and subtitle that are vertically aligned.
- Another card about 24px below the previous card with more stats (live info)
- A lot of previous times someone has pressed the button in a scrolling from with no border. Each of these moments is displayed as more stats like the cards in previous sections.
- More cards, this time, displayed horizontally. The cards contain a small title that is centered and in a less prominent text color. They also have a description containing larger white text that pops. The description text is also vertically centered.
- Tokenomics
	- More cards, horizontally displayed, explaining the tokenomics of the token "$YEET."
	- Includes Initial supply, taxes, and tax distribution.
- Footer
	- Includes only the contract address and the email for the project. Vertically centered. Each on their own line.

## What makes it Memeworthy?
The overuse of rounded corners and nested elements are a subtle hint that this wasn't designed by a professional. And that is the goal of this web design strategy. It also uses contrasting colors that normally wouldn't look good together either, but since a lot of the content is black and white, it works.
Another subtle hint is that lots of the text is centered. This is often reserved for special cases but yeetdajeetz overuses it possibly intentionally.
