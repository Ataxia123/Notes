Course Title: Elixir Programming with NerdBrain Research Standards

Course Description: 
This course will provide an introduction to Elixir programming, a functional, concurrent, high-level general-purpose language that runs on the BEAM virtual machine. The course will also incorporate the NerdBrain Research Standards, teaching students how to apply these principles to their programming and research efforts.
