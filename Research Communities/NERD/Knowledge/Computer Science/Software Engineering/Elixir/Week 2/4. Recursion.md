# Recursion
Recursive functions are an important concept in Elixir because they allow us to solve problems by breaking them down into smaller, simpler versions of themselves. This leads to concise and elegant code.

Let's consider the problem of calculating the factorial of a number, which is the product of all positive integers from 1 to that number. For example, the factorial of 5 (written as 5!) is 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 = 120.

To calculate the factorial of a number using recursion in Elixir, we can define a function like this:

```elixir
defmodule Math do
  def factorial(0), do: 1
  def factorial(n), do: n * factorial(n-1)
end
```

Here's a breakdown of why recursion is the best solution for this problem:

1. Base case: We define a base case `factorial(0)` which returns 1. This is the simplest form of the problem, and we know that the factorial of 0 is 1.
2. Recursive case: For any other positive number `n`, we calculate the factorial by multiplying `n` with the factorial of `n-1` (`n * factorial(n-1)`). This is where the function calls itself with a smaller input, moving closer to the base case with each recursive call.
3. Progressive simplification: Each recursive call reduces the problem size by 1, until we reach the base case. This guarantees that eventually we will reach the base case and stop the recursion.

Recursion is the best solution for this problem because it naturally captures the repetitive nature of the factorial calculation. By breaking down the problem into smaller subproblems (finding the factorial of `n-1`), we can solve the larger problem iteratively without the need for complex loops or mutable state variables.

In Elixir, recursion can be a powerful tool for solving a wide range of problems, as it allows us to express complex algorithms in a concise and readable way.
