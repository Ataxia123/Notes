# Functional Programming
Functional programming is a programming paradigm that emphasizes the use of immutable data and pure functions. In functional programming, you don't have objects and classes like you would in object-oriented programming. Instead, you have functions that take input and produce output, without modifying any shared state or relying on global variables.

Here's how functional programming works:

1. Immutable Data: In functional programming, data is immutable, which means it cannot be modified after it is created. Instead of changing data, you create new data structures with modified values.
2. Pure Functions: Functions in functional programming are pure, meaning they always produce the same output for the same input and have no side effects. They don't modify any data outside their own scope or rely on external state.
3. Higher-order Functions: Functional programming encourages the use of higher-order functions, which are functions that can take other functions as arguments or return functions as results. This allows for powerful abstractions and composability.

Now, let's address why the absence of objects and classes in Elixir is not a problem:

1. Elixir uses modules to organize functions: Modules in Elixir act as namespaces and allow you to group related functions together. You can define functions within modules, which provides a way to organize your code logically.
2. Elixir's lightweight processes: Elixir makes use of lightweight processes, called "actors", for concurrency and parallelism. These processes can communicate with each other by sending messages. So, instead of objects, Elixir provides a message-passing model for communication.
3. Elixir embraces immutability and functional programming: Elixir's functional programming approach, combined with immutable data, makes it easier to reason about your code and avoid common bugs caused by mutable state.

To give you a mental model for using Elixir, consider the following steps:

1. Identify the data transformations: Think about the inputs and outputs of your problem. Break down the problem into smaller data transformations that can be solved with pure functions.
2. Write pure functions: Design and implement pure functions that transform your data. Remember to keep them focused, reusable, and without side effects.
3. Compose functions: Use higher-order functions to compose smaller functions into larger ones. This allows you to build complex behavior by combining simple and reusable functions.
4. Utilize pattern matching: Elixir uses pattern matching extensively, which allows you to define different function clauses based on the shape or content of your data. This helps you handle different cases and make your code more expressive.

By following these steps, you can effectively leverage the power of functional programming and Elixir's features to write clean, maintainable, and scalable code.
