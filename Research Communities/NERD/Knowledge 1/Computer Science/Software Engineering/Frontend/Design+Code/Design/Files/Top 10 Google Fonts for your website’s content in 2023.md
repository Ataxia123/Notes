# Top 10 Google Fonts for your website’s content in 2023
Bold headings and colorful text are often the first things people notice on a company’s website.

Attractive fonts invite users to scroll down and view the products and services — but the wrong fonts can sometimes drive them away.

Companies need to find a balance between [accessible, easy-to-read fonts](https://webflow.com/blog/web-safe-fonts) and unique lettering that emphasizes their brand. Building a cohesive brand isn’t always easy, but staying loyal to a font streamlines the reading experience on any website.   

## Is the website you created ready to launch?

It may seem like a minor detail, but choosing the right font for the brand you’re working with is crucial. Think about your target audience and the message you want to convey to your website’s visitors.

Whether serif or sans serif, your website’s font is key to user experience. (If you don’t know what serif fonts are, we recommend skimming through our introduction to [web typography](https://webflow.com/blog/web-typography-101).)

But where can you find the best fonts for your website? This guide will look at Google Fonts, one of the best online resources for fonts to elevate your website to its full potential.

## What is Google Fonts?

[Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/about) is an open-source library that houses hundreds of fonts that allows you to browse font families and test different typefaces in over 135 languages. You can download all these font files for free.

Google Fonts will even tell you a little about each font, such as its designer, related work, and data on the font's trends and usage. Additionally, Google sorts its fonts according to your area's popularity, consumer patterns, and trends.

This library allows you to filter fonts according to their families and weights. You can also test [color combinations](https://webflow.com/blog/best-color-combinations) with samples to create personalized font collections. You can even streamline your design process by sharing these collections with other team members. 

Some of Google Fonts’ best features include that the fonts are:

-   **Free:** Google offers open-source fonts, which means they’re free to use. You can distribute and modify them according to your needs.
-   **Ready for commercial use:** Google Fonts are available for commercial use, so you can use them for marketing purposes or on any of your products.
-   **Compatible with websites and Android OS:** You can use Google Fonts if you’re developing an Android app, as long as you have Android Jelly Bean or a later version. Google also allows you to embed Google Fonts directly into your website, helping your branding stay consistent across platforms.
-   **Good for branding:** You can easily use Google Fonts on printed products, e-books, storefronts, jewelry, educational materials, and other surfaces.
-   **Modifiable**: You can alter a Google Font with any design software and use it commercially. You can change a font’s spacing, thickness, or slope.

The good news is that you don’t have to browse through hundreds of fonts and test different combinations to find the perfect font for your website. We’ve compiled a list of some of the best Google Fonts you can use for your website today.

### 8\. Oswald

Oswald is a sans serif font designed by Vernon Adams. It comes in seven different weights: extra light, light, regular, medium, semibold, bold, and heavy regular. We recommend using Oswald for headings — its bold appearance stands out and combines well with thinner fonts.

Like Oswald, Raleway’s thicker weights make it stand out when used for titles and headings. It was designed by Matt McInerney, Pablo Impallari, and Rodrigo Fuenzalida and is a sans serif typeface that is particularly popular among designers today due to its versatility. It pairs well with both modern and classic fonts.

Now that we’ve reviewed some top Google fonts, let’s explore how to pair them. 

## Font combinations

Using a single font for your entire website can sometimes become monotonous (although there are exceptions to this idea). When using two fonts, keep one for the headings and the other for the body. Bonus points if they slightly resemble each other. 

If you’re interested in mixing and matching, check out our article on [pairing fonts](https://webflow.com/blog/font-pairing) to learn how to guide the eye with greater control. Here are our favorite font combinations using the most popular Google Fonts for your website.

### 1\. Montserrat and Barlow Condensed

Montserrat is one of the design industry’s most-loved fonts. It’s a minimal typeface that allows enough breathing space to make reading comfortable on any webpage. Use Montserrat in your main text and pair it with Barlow Condensed, whose letters are spaced closer together.

![Barlow Condensed and Montserrat fonts](https://assets-global.website-files.com/6009ec8cda7f305645c9d91b/633ca6a93b2c36641dfb04a1_6334ae13554ebf5c79a001d0_google-fonts-barlow-condensed-montserrat.png)

### 2\. Alegreya Regular and Bold

Using a single font doesn’t have to be boring. Use different styles to make the most of it. Alegreya is an elegant font and comes in 16 different styles, but we like to pair its Regular weight with Alegreya Bold.

![Alegreya Regular and Bold fonts](https://assets-global.website-files.com/6009ec8cda7f305645c9d91b/633ca6a93b2c3669fafb04a5_6334ae6fa8a401f1c8b2f833_google-fonts-alegreya-bold-regular.png)

### 3\. Roboto and Roboto Condensed

No Google Fonts list is complete without Roboto. It’s the mainstay of Google web text, and these two weights from the same font family complement each other very well.

![Roboto and Roboto Condensed fonts](https://assets-global.website-files.com/6009ec8cda7f305645c9d91b/633ca6a93b2c36e6fdfb04a4_6334ae9d41ac0db5b00a1b96_google-fonts-robot-condensed-roboto.png)

[_Source: Fontpair_](https://www.fontpair.co/pairings/roboto-condensed-roboto)

### 4\. Oswald and Source Serif Pro

Oswald and Source Serif Pro is a classic example of pairing a sans serif font with a serif one. Oswald stands out with its thicker weight, while Source Serif Pro allows for comfortable reading. Source Sans Pro is also a great option if you want a sans font.

![Oswald and Source Serif Pro fonts](https://assets-global.website-files.com/6009ec8cda7f305645c9d91b/633ca6a93b2c36b267fb0499_6334aeb9e6fe20c7c4106054_google-fonts-oswald-source-serif-pro.png)
