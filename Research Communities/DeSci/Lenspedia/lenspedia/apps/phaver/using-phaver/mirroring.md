# Mirroring

Think of mirroring as repurposing someone else's post and sharing it in a new environment

You mirror a post when:&#x20;

1. You see a post on the Phaver feed that you like&#x20;
2. You don't feel like creating original content
3. You feel that the post will be suitable content for a different topic on Phaver

### Mirroring process
