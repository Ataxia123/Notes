# Share content to Lens

A share to Lens button can help distribue your application and its content to a larger audience. You can create a "Share to Lens" button easily via [Lenster](https://lenster.xyz/) using HTML.

```
https://lenster.xyz/?text=Hello%20World!
```

The following url parameters are supported:

```
text
url
via
hashtags
```

So for example, let's say we have an app called "MyCoolApp" and we wanted to share some content from it to Lens, we could format a URL that looks like this:

```
https://lenster.xyz/?text=Hello%20World!&url=https://mycoolapp.xyz&via=MyCoolApp&hashtags=lens,web3
```

We would get the following share modal on Lenster:
