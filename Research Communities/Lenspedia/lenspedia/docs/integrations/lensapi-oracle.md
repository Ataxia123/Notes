# LensAPI Oracle

The Lens API enables developers to perform aggregations and complex queries of Lens data via web and mobile applications using HTTP requests.

This data is not available to smart contract developers though, so they are limited to interacting directly with the Lens smart contracts which do not offer the same variety of rich queries that are available through the API.

The Lens API Oracle offers an easy way to access verifiable Lens API data in smart contracts.
