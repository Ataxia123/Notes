# Curate content from web2 social

Creating high quality original content is hard. Not everyone is a creator themselves but can see value in the things that other create.&#x20;

Thats why Phaver has made it super easy for users to curate the best content from web2 and bring it across to the web3.&#x20;

There is no doubt - Web2 has some incredible content. Creators across a number of different platforms including instagram, Twitter, Reddit generate some very educational, entertaining and creative content. \

In the early stages of Web3 social - we believe that it's far better to bring value across from web2 social than starting completely from scratch.&#x20;
