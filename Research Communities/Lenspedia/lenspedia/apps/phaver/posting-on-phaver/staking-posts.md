# Staking posts

## What is staking?&#x20;

You can think of "staking" as another word for "voting"

Phaver uses a staking feature to enable the Phaver community to signal valuable posts to the rest of the community

<mark style="color:yellow;">You can earn rewards In Phaver points by staking on valuable content in the feed</mark>\


* Staking on a post early (before others) means you will earn Phaver token rewards If that post becomes popular and more people stake on it after you stake.&#x20;
* To stake on a post you need to use up one of the 5 staking tokens Phaver provides for you to use.&#x20;
* Staking on a post is currently free, but will cost a small amount of the Phaver utility token in the future so that users have "skin-in-the game"&#x20;
