# Phaver SBT's

Your SBT represents your web2 history so that you can bring the essence of your web2-self into into the web3. \


A Soulbound Token (SBT) is a tool that allows us to verify your social influence on Discord and Twitter. To apply for an SBT, simply connect your Twitter and Discord accounts. If your stats meet our criteria, you will receive an airdrop of the SBT to the wallet that you connected. We will make announcements on Twitter and Discord for each SBT update.

* Each wallet that has been allowlisted is eligible to receive only one SBT. SBTs are non-transferable assets.
* Only SBT holders with high stats have a chance to get Lens WL. You can update your stats on the same page on a weekly basis.

## FAQ's

### **What is Soulbound Token?**

Soulbound tokens are non-transferable nonfungible tokens (NFT). STBs that are minted by a specific wallet will remain in that wallet forever. SBTâ€™s can be used to represent an individual wallet userâ€™s credentials, affiliations and commitments.

### **I don't use Twitter. Can I connect my Instagram and TikTok accounts instead of it?**&#x20;

Currently, users can apply SBT by connecting only Twitter and Discord. However, we will be rolling out new integrations with other social media apps in the future.

### **Why is Twitter so important for you? I am a Phaver** ðŸ¦„ **degen, not Twitter!**

The SBT is one of our verification mechanisms. Web3 should be equally accessible for everyone and we should care about our friends from Web2. Phaver and SBT can be the first steps toward Web3. As part of the Phaver family, we care about this and believe that this is the right way to move forward for mass adoption: a Web 2.5 approach.
