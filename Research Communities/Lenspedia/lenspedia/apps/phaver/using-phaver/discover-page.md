* The cost - Currently its costs 50 Phaver points to make a post into a premium topic
* The benefit - when people stake on your premium topic post you get 10 Phaver points per stake (current tokenomics)
* The conclusion - If you make a post into a premium topic, then you will earn more Phaver points than it costs if your posts gets 5 stakes or more.&#x20;

### What Premium is all about?&#x20;

Premium topics are Phaver's token layer in action.&#x20;

Simple game theory is used to increase the quality of the content posted of Phaver.\
When it costs users something to make a post and good quality is rewarded highly - the incentive to post something that is of good quality increases dramatically.

**Examples of good and bad posts**

Posting something of poor quality that gets 1 stake:

* It will cost you 50 Points&#x20;
* You may get 1 stake (10 Points)&#x20;
* \= A total loss of 40 points on that post

A great quality post that gets 25 stakes:

* Will again cost you 50 points&#x20;
* but with 25 stakes (250 points)&#x20;
* \= you earn the reward of 200 additional Phaver points

### The Flow: Posting to Premium&#x20;

1. Make a post like you would normally
2. Select the premium topic that you want to post into
3. View and confirm the topic, points required to make the post + remaining posts before posting
