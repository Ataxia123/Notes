# Following

Following people is a way in which you can curate your content feed by following people that post content that you like

1. You can follow people directly from the discover page by clicking the "+" icon&#x20;
2. By clicking on the follow button underneath their Avatar
3. The follow button will be either <mark style="color:purple;">purple</mark> or <mark style="color:green;">green</mark> depending on whether they have a Lens profile or not
