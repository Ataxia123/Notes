> **Common challenges facing fintech today**
>
> Globally, fintechs often face three interrelated challenges that
> development funders can help to address through strategic, coordinated
> investments:
>
> **(i) Inefficient market conditions.** Without the right
> infrastructure, policies and regulatory frameworks, and support from
> governments and civil society, fintechs cannot grow in a safe and
> sustainable way (Pazarbasioglu et al. 2020). India is a good example
> of how certain market conditions enable fintechs to thrive. Mobile
> technology, combined with the country's interconnected set of
> government-facilitated financial systems commonly referred to as the
> India Stack, has connected millions nationwide to the financial system
> and enabled a wide array of fintech business models to scale.1 In

> support does not exist, fintechs struggle to scale beyond the most
> tech-savvy, urban, young, and affluent customers.
>
> **(ii) Accessing capital at all growth stages.** Fintech growth
> depends on access to the right kind of capital---whether early-stage
> capital to prove the viability of a business model, growth capital to
> achieve scale and sustainability, or debt finance to fund new credit
> portfolios. These different types of capital are often missing in
> EMDEs or are accessible only to the most\
> well-connected entrepreneurs. Fintechs describe funding as their
> biggest challenge, especially in the early and growth stages.
>
> **(iii) Reaching and impacting poor customers.** It takes time even
> for fintechs with the best of intentions to impact large numbers of
> low-income customers. When capital infusions come on the condition of
> a quick return, it can be even more difficult for fintechs to be
> inclusive. In certain cases, the drive for profit can even lead to
> consumer protection risks. Customer impact in an individual market
> rarely depends on the rapid success of a single company but on
>
> the emergence of a wide variety of firms serving several customer
> segments over time.
>
> **Addressing challenges with a strategic, coordinated funding
> approach**
>
> Over the past decade, both commercial investors and development
> funders in EMDEs increasingly have invested in fintech. Funding
> directly and indirectly flows to the sector in many ways, whether to
> support individual fintechs or to create an enabling environment for
> the fintech ecosystem through regulatory reform, infrastructure
> development, or market research (see Figure 1).

**Fintechs**

> The amount of money invested in fintech has been on the rise in recent
> years. According to KPMG, global investment in fintech grew from \$51
> billion in 2014 to \$135.7 billion in 2019 (the COVID-19 pandemic
> slowed investment in 2020).2 However, little data exists on where
> development funding is flowing relative to commercial funding---and
> the impact it may be having. It is still unclear whether development
> funding complements commercial funding, builds a more conducive
> environment for commercial investors to enter, or enables fintech to
> reach low-income populations.
>
> Recent research from CGAP and MIX, a global data resource on the
> funding and impact of inclusive financial services, has begun to shed
> light on these questions.3**Analysis of data from the world's largest
> development funders and nearly 100 fintechs shows that funding from
> both commercial investors and development funders targets mature
> companies with proven business models.**The fintechs overwhelmingly
> are payment wallets and lenders, most likely because those products
> have been in the market longer and have a clearer pathway to
> profitability.

> Funding for more diverse or riskier innovations is more difficult to

> crowding-in of local or international commercial capital exists,
> especially in Africa. While markets like Indonesia already appear to
> be saturated by commercial investors, impact-focused, early-stage
> fintechs still struggle to find early funding. CGAP's interviews with
> fintechs show that support beyond funding---such as access to capital
> markets and technical assistance---is still lacking, especially among
> early-stage fintechs.
>
> Development funders will need to pursue a coordinated, long-term
> approach to fill funding gaps and better address the challenges
> fintech currently faces. The microfinance sector stands as a useful
> example of how this can be achieved. Like fintech today, in its early
> days microfinance attracted a wide variety of commercial investors and
> development funders. As the sector evolved, their approaches became
> more coordinated. Development finance institutions (DFIs) boosted
> investor confidence through microfinance investment vehicles (MIVs)
> and attracted more commercial and impact investors. This led to a
> period of sustained growth that resulted in \$17 billion worth of
> investments in microfinance in 2018 alone (Symbiotics 2019). Further,
> donors supported development of standards and data reporting, and
> influenced financial regulations and financial inclusion policy in
> countries to formalize microfinance. Many countries now have
> regulatory frameworks that support the operation of microfinance, and
> many MFIs have become licensed deposit-taking institutions.
>
> We see a similar opportunity in fintech today. Through coordinated
> action, certain market gaps can be tackled: a lack of capital in
> Africa, market distortions in overcrowded Asian markets, lack of
> reliable information on impact, and, perhaps most crucially,
> insufficient support for early-stage innovation. Engagement with
> fintech companies sits outside the core funding instruments of most
> development funders because fintechs are often too small and/or early
> stage. As a result, the impact of fintechs on poor people remains
> largely hypothesized. The COVID-19 pandemic has demonstrated that the
> right digital innovations can have a critical impact on poor people
> and increase their resilience to shocks (CCAF, World Bank Group, and
> WEF 2020), and many development funders are now looking for ways to
> maximize fintech's impact. It is an opportune time to recalibrate
> efforts.

> **Focus Note overview**
>
> This Focus Note presents a vision for how development funders can
> support fintech in EMDEs to enable innovative business models that
> provide greater impact for poor people.
>
> It describes how development funders can structure investments and
> work toward a coordinated approach with other development funders. We
> offer guidance in three main areas that would help address the
> challenges faced by fintechs, as previously outlined:
>
> 1\. **Assessing and managing the impact potential** of fintech
> investments
>
> 2\. **Strategicallyfunding** to achieve impact and business potential
>
> 3\. **Influencing the market** to support an ecosystem of fintechs
> that serve low-income customers
>
> Guidance presented in this paper is based on interviews with
> international donors,\
> foundations, DFIs, and development agencies, as well as industry
> experts and researchers. We also conducted four country-level
> assessments of fintechs in India, Indonesia, Mexico, and Nigeria.
> Across these markets, CGAP interviewed 60 fintechs at different stages
> of growth. We interviewed local investors and local representatives of
> development funders (both mature and early-stage investors, where
> possible), and other ecosystem stakeholders such as incubators,
> accelerators, fintech associations, and industry bodies. All the
> research for this paper was conducted between 2018--2020. Although

> **Impact and risks at different fintech stages**

> There is a general understanding that a fintech company's lifecycle

> **EARLy-STAGE IMPACT**\
> **Identifying solutions that address market gaps for excluded groups**
> A wide range of early-stage fintech models offer exciting

> any kind of impact in the early years of operation, since they may
> often have to prioritize financial viability and scale over impact.
> Venture capital plays a key role, not only to develop a business that

> often difficult to find in less developed markets. Yet funding
> fintechs at the early stage is important because it enables the launch

> carried out by early-stage businesses also reveals important lessons
> for markets about what works and what does not. These insights can

> Most early-stage fintechs claim to bring new solutions to an existing
> customer problem. In some instances they focus on traditionally
> excluded groups. In the four countries CGAP researched, early-stage
> business models generally shared the following characteristics:
>
> • *Experimentation with new forms of scoring or underwriting* for
> credit products, such as using satellite data for agri-insurance,
> value chain analysis for micro and small enterprise (MSE) loans, and
> tracking savings group transactions for consumer loans.
>
> • *Introduction of new features and delivery mechanisms* for
> conventional products, especially those aimed at serving excluded
> segments.
>
> • *Balance between digital and in-person customer interaction*,
> especially by creating the on-the-ground partnerships that are key to
> serving excluded segments with complex products.
>
> In Nigeria, PiggyVest is an example of an early-stage fintech that
> brings savings and investments to a segment typically excluded from
> wealth creation opportunities. Its innovative use of an intuitive app
> and easy-to-use features help customers create savings or investment
> wallets differentiated by goals or risk. A similar model has scaled
> considerably in the United States, but this type of fintech business
> model is still finding its feet in markets like Nigeria where banking
> penetration is much lower.
>
> Another example of an early-stage model is Toffee, an innovative
> insurance delivery fintech in India that acts a bridge between
> low-income customers who may be new to insurance and traditional
> insurance companies. The company provides simple insurance policies

> to protect customers against the risks most relevant to them, such as
> dengue, malaria, hospital cash, bicycle damage, and theft. Simplified
> sign-up processes on a mobile app and at the point of sale expedite
> easy access. See Appendix A and Appendix B for additional examples.
>
> Given the nascency of their business models, development funders
> should pick impact indicators that reveal how early-stage firms can
> solve a market gap for excluded groups. **The focus of this stage is
> that fintechs develops services that satisfies a clear market demand
> by excluded and underserved segments.**In contrast with existing
> solutions, these services can show gains in cost, accessibility, fit
> and/or experience, all of which can make financial services work
> better for low-income users (see Figure 4).
>
> The four criteria of impact in this framework apply to fintechs at all
> stages. As fintechs mature they must also have deeper impact on the
> market and their customers' lives- we will describe these deeper
> impacts in the next sections. But at the minimum, they must excel in
> one of these areas of customer value.
>
> Early-stage fintechs have the potential to create multiple effects.
> For instance, a fintech that has figured out how to reduce the cost of
> offering agricultural insurance to smallholder farmers concurrently
> may expand access. The sample scorecard in Box 1 may be useful to
> development funders looking to assess impact of an early-stage
> fintech.

> potential it expects as it launches and scales. For example, an

>
> Replicability of a business model refers to the ability of additional
> players to create a company using the same model (or variations on it)
> in the same or other markets. Complex, one-off products that only work
> in a certain region may be useful for a particular market and its
> customers but offer limited impact across a portfolio of fintech
> investments.
>
> Thinking about replicability can help development funders identify how
> a growing firm or set of firms with the same business model can
> increase market competition or improve consumer choice---both
> important aspects of achieving financial inclusion.
>
> Replicability may be most relevant to DFIs since they structure direct
> and indirect investments to holistically build a market. Replicability
> of a business model helps build market confidence and influence
> investment from other local funders, which is a key goal for these
> stakeholders.
>
> M-Shwari, a digital credit product that continues to experience steady
> growth in East Africa, is a good example of a replicable business
> model. Within three years of its launch, ten new digital credit
> products also emerged in the market, including products from firms
> like Tala and Branch that also have substantially scaled since. The
> industry has yet to define and codify which of the product's key
> features---a combination of alternative credit scoring and rapid
> credit history building---contribute to making it work.

> Kopo Kopo in Kenya stands as another example. The company specializes
> in solutions that allow merchants to receive payments from digital
> wallets. Scaling up their customer base has been a difficult goal for

> Public development funders, therefore, have reason to directly engage

> Credible data about the overall impacts of mature payments services is

> study used granular data on transactions from Paytm, one of India's
> largest mobile money service providers with over 400 million users.
> The study discovered that Paytm use increased resilience by dampening
> the impact of weather shocks on economic activity and household
> consumption (Patnam and Yao 2020). Specifically, while rainfall shocks
> had a significantly negative impact on economic activity, proxied by
> satellite data on nighttime lights, the effect was partially mitigated
> in districts that used mobile money, reducing it by an average of 23
> percent. The authors observed that a 10 percent increase in mobile
> money use in districts hit by a rainfall shock reduced the shock's
> negative effects by 3 percent. In addition, a targeted intervention
> that emerged from the study showed that firms that receive payments
> through Paytm improve sales by approximately 26 percent after six
> months of use, relative to firms that do not receive payments through
> Paytm. Similarly, research by Jack and Suri (2014) in Kenya showed
> that mobile money had a significant impact on the ability of
> households to share risk, producing an average welfare benefit of 3 to
> 4 percent of total income.
>
> **Despite studies like these, not enough is known about the welfare
> effects of mature payments companies today.** Development funders
> should support fintechs that can help bring unbiased evidence of
> deeper outcomes and welfare effects on customers into the public
> domain. Neutrality and rigor are key, and perhaps may mean relying on
> independent researchers or implementers on the ground to produce
> reliable insights.
>
> Beyond the sphere of payments, even less evidence exists. Digital
> credit products may expand access to capital for individuals and MSEs,
> but whether they reach them with the right types of loans for their
> goals is not clear. For instance, M-Shwari type working capital loans
> are widespread, but it is not clear whether small firms in Kenya can
> readily access bigger loans for asset finance or expansion using these
> new fintech credit products. Moreover, whether these loans lead to
> welfare effects or whether new credit scoring models are equitably
> available to all socio-cultural segments (e.g., minorities,
> women-owned businesses) is also not clear due to lack of data and
> research.
>
> The different stages fintechs pass through means that development
> funders must sequence their measurement of impact. **A focus on
> business model stages helps sequence impact from basic to deep, across
> a diverse portfolio of investments. It also allows fintechs the space
> to achieve goals sustainably, only being held accountable to targets

> As companies scale from the early stage to the growth stage, their

>
> Even those previously successful at raising funds may face a scarcity

> institutions because lenders expect an established track record as

>
> DFIs are especially helpful in filling this gap because they
> responsibly enable access to debt capitalor create incentives for

> only 11 percent of direct funding by public development funders is
> debt capital to fintechs (Baur-Yazbeck 2021). Several growth stage
> companies interviewed by CGAP credit DFIs with helping crowd in
> private debt capital. **Increased provision of such debt capital for
> responsible, growing companies would help crowd in local investors and
> financial institutions.**
>
> Insurance and savings models nearing the growth stage may also face
> unique challenges. They may have been successful in their quest for

> to attract investment. The newness of these models and the uncertainty
> of regulatory openness to the models means that many face existential

> requires high compliance and licensing costs, these fintechs often act
> as distributors for banks or insurance underwriters. Those that serve
> low-income segments rely more heavily on touch than tech to reach
> excluded groups. For these reasons they tend to take longer to become
> profitable and represent some risk due to their business model's
> dependency on partnerships.
>
> Commercial investors do not have adequate examples of models such as

> Blended finance models are another solution for funding complex or
> risky fintech models. These models strategically use development
> (often donor) funding to mobilize additional finance (commercial
> capital) toward the SDGs in developing countries. Blended finance is
> an umbrella term for many different types of funding instruments, and
> a powerful tool development funders can use to crowd in additional
> investment (Scola, Moretto, and Lahaye 2018). It can include the
> guarantees, junior capital, or technical assistance that accompanies
> investment, but its main goal is to help absorb risk in a way that
> influences private investors to commit even when they consider
> investment risky. This can take a growth stage company to the mature
> stage where the model is proven, risks are known, and donor funding is
> no longer required since commercial capital can fill needs. For
> example, blended finance could fund agriculture-focused fintechs as
> they test, scale, and attract private capital in the long term.

> **Deepen and generate evidence of impact on excluded**\

> If public development funders engage with mature fintechs through

> a\. **Sharing lessons learned.** Even before discussing quantifiable

> comfort around fintech business models. Development funders with a
> track record for supporting fintech must discuss lessons learned from
> both successes and failures. For instance, a 2018 paper by Flourish

> portfolio companies (Stout and Parbhoo 2018). Reports like these hold
> great value in our field, especially those based on lessons directly
> learned by development funders within their portfolios.
>
> b\. **Sharing impact criteria.** As development funders invest in
> specific business models, from assessment to conclusion of funding,
> they formulate their own understanding of the impact that is possible.
> But very little is publicly shared, and the impact potential of a
> fintech that the development funder shares in a press release is
> rarely followed up on with impact results. As a result, **the impact

> learnings on returns must be kept confidential, it is important,
> especially for public development funders, to share learnings on
> crucial impact evidence that emerged across models. Quantifiable,
> rigorous impact studies on fintech are still rare. Except for mobile
> money in East Africa, we know very little about fintech's impact
> beyond basic numbers on access and use, and most of the time, that,
> too, is missing. The lack of data and insight on fintech's effects is
> a feature in all new sectors.
>
> In some cases, not only is the data on impact missing but the very
> impact itself, and it is too early to assess. The industry could
> benefit from the impact stories currently available on some mature
> models.
>
> c\. **Standardizing metrics.** The heterogeneity of business models
> complicates efforts to create global metrics and standards for
> fintechs. CGAP has found this most visible in the PAYGo PERFORM
> initiative, an effort to standardize metrics for PAYGo asset finance
> business models.9 National and regional fintech associations also play
> an important role in standardization but development funders bring
> influence that helps globally embed metrics across the sector and
> ensure its use in reporting. Notably, supported by a set of

> *What is the nature of B2B and B2C fintech innovation across payments,
> credit, savings, and insurance? Which key technological components are
> essential for these products to work in their markets?*
>
> **Payments**
>
> Fintech has significantly transformed payments services, particularly
> in reducing costs of remittances and transactions for customers. It
> has also eased merchant acquisition costs. The revolution sparked by
> M-PESA is the most recognized and established payment innovation in
> the digital financial inclusion space. Broadly, fintech payments have
> been enabled by (i) increased penetration of smartphones among
> customers and POS devices among merchants, enabling QR codes and data
> tracking, respectively, (ii) the availability of back-end technologies
> such as cloud and APIs to help connect fintech payments services to
> banks, and (iii) public financial infrastructure such as IDs, payment
> switches, and interfaces---all key to ensuring widespread penetration
> to the base of the pyramid.
>
> **INNOvATIvE BUSINESS MODELS**\
> Payments super apps, wallets, and remittance services offer low-cost
> pricing, easy-to-use interfaces, and access to a variety of services.
> Payments companies focus on scale and acquiring a large customer base,
> which allows them to monetize the data that result from

> transactions. In many markets in Asia, payments companies (especially
> payment wallets) rely on large equity investments from shareholders to
> reduce or eliminate customer fees. They often provide cashbacks on
> transactions to drive scale. An open question exists on whether these
> types of services can be commercially sustainable. So far, the answer
> has been difficult to assess during the growth stage.
>
> Services aimed at merchants generally are fee-basedper transaction,
> although revenue from providing credit to these merchants is becoming
> more important to some providers. This topic is further discussed in
> the section on credit below.
>
> Payments services such as payments gateways connect financial
> institutions and MSMEs through digital technologies like APIs. Their
> purpose is to create new value for existing customers or expand the
> customer base, and to help ease enrollments and transactions. These
> payments services, too, charge transaction fees---either to the
> financial institution or the end customer.
>
> **IMPACT**\
> Research conducted by Suri (2017) demonstrated that mobile money could
> have an impact on poverty reduction. Recent research released by the
> IMF (Patnam and Yao 2020) and BIS (da Silva et al. 2019) states that
> digital payments services help reduce inequality and help MSEs more
> effectively weather shocks.
>
> **Credit**
>
> Digital credit in emerging markets first scaled as a simple model for
> consumer credit in East Africa. It since has expanded to many segments
> and loan types, as well as a category of back-end services for
> traditional lenders.
>
> Digital credit targets those underserved by existing credit services,
> so technology is mainly used to expand risk assessment and eligibility
> (Chen and Mazer 2016).Advanced data analytics and machine learning,
> which help analyze a customer's digital behavior or a firm's
> transactions and activities, are therefore significant to the business
> model. Basic cloud platforms and APIs are necessary to link with
> underwriting banks or lending institutions. App-based lenders reach
> customers directly, analyze their phone data in order to lend to them,
> and service loans and repayments through the app interface (Fernandez
> Vidal and Hwang 2017).
>
> **INNOvATIvE BUSINESS MODELS**\
> **B2C services.** B2C services lend directly to the customer. The main
> revenue here is the interest fee they are charged. The cost of
> operations substantially changes depending on loan type and segment
> type.
>
> Digital credit providers lend against behavioral data gleaned from
> electronic data usage rather than against collateral or security. They
> may observe a customer's payment transactions or analyze electronic
> invoices to make lending decisions.

> Another significant point of distinction is whether a fintech lends
> off its own balance sheet or someone else's. Balance sheet lenders
> tend to be larger and well established. Few companies have been able
> to reach the scale and credibility needed to attract debt capital for
> direct lending. Examples include Aye Finance in India and Branch, a
> company that operates in several markets across Africa. Non-balance-
> sheet lending is newer. It is an interim solution for fintechs that
> have yet to scale and instead lend on behalf of others. Peer-to-peer
> (P2P) credit and crowdfunding are examples.
>
> **B2B lending services** offer credit acquiring, credit scoring, loan
> processing, and collection services to established lenders and
> financial instutions. Revenue for the fintech is per client/per loan
> serviced by the financial institution. Its revenue is baked into the
> interest charged to the end borrower. Regardless, it is crucial for
> these firms to prove validity and effectiveness in their early stages.
> If fintechs fail to secure debt capital after the initial growth
> stage, they sometimes transform from direct lenders into
> vendor/partners for financial institutions that offer their technology
> stack as a service.
>
> **IMPACT**\
> It is unclear whether digital credit products solve for larger credit
> gaps in the market or lead to welfare effects at an aggregate level.
> Evidence from analyzing new digital credit scoring models in the
> United States showed inequity and bias for socio-cultural segments
> such as minorities and women-owned businesses (da Silva et al. 2019).
> Similar effects in EMDEs are unknown.
>
> **Insurance and savings**
>
> Fintechs that offer insurance and savings tend to be newer. Their

> of impact. The following two sections on insurance and savings focus

> **INSURETCH**\
> Most fintechs do not begin as insurance underwriters since insurance
> licenses generally carry large capital requirements. Innovation in
> this area, also known as "insuretech," has focused on rewiring how
> insurance is packaged and sold. Innovations in marketing, delivery,
> and customer experience make a product appear more flexible,
> customized, and simplified.
>
> The technology is deployed in three key ways: (i) data analytics to
> reduce the cost of assessment and claims, (ii) digital apps and
> platforms that act as distribution channels, and (iii)
> internet-enabled sensors and predictive risk modeling that result in
> prevention of events and better claims management for both businesses
> and customers.
>
> **Innovative business models**\
> Insuretech modularizes key aspects of insurance to make the core
> product more accessible.The business model is fee- or
> commission-based, per customer or per transaction. Most insuretech
> companies are brokers or agents. At the back end, their products are
> underwritten by large licensed insurance companies.
>
> Insuretech innovations that specifically target poor people have just
> begun to emerge.
>
> Good ideas do exist for reaching underserved individuals and
> low-income customers through better fit and experience, but without
> patient capital many innovative ideas soon die. Attracting investment
> at the Series A level or higher is difficult, and learnings from EMDE
> models at the industry level are limited.
>
> As more and more newly digital customers emerge in a market,
> insuretech companies may use the data they generate to enhance pricing
> or automate claims. Toffee, an Indian micro-insurer of bicycles and
> other products often relevant to poor people, is developing a fully
> digital claims experience that allows customers to submit and track
> claims

**The Rise of P2P Lending**

> P2P lending is a fast-growing non-balance sheet lending model,
> especially in China and less pervasively in Indonesia and India. PP2P
> fintechs connect lender funds with borrowers; and offer the lenders
> higher than average earnings. They take on part of non-repayment risk
> to build trust in the system.
>
> Largely borrowers are small-businesses or daily traders with cash-flow
> needs.
>
> **Advantage:** Reduces risk to lend; connects unused funds with
> lenders.
>
> **Disadvantage:** Without credit bureaus, systemic
>
> through smartphone apps. In all markets, however, data-based pricing
> and claims processing can cause unintended negative consequences such
> as discrimination\
> based on race, gender, and/or occupation. Regulation is needed to
> protect customers.
>
> For now, because insuretech is new in\
> most emerging markets, regulators are still playing catch-up to the
> rapid technological developments in the sector.
>
> **SAvINGS AND**\

>
> M segments in their fintech, such as smallholder farmers, MSEs, and
> women. Fintechs can reach these segments through targeted products or
> via scale. This **ANY DEVELOPMENT FUNDERS FOCUS ON SPECIFIC EXCLUDED**
>
> Appendix summarizes the major fintech innovations that exist for these
> segments today.
>
> **Rural and agricultural livelihoods**\
> **(smallholder farmers)**
>
> **THE PAIN POINT**\
> Smallholder farmers make up an excluded customer segment that is
> considered risky and costly to serve. Their livelihoods and value
> chains are not fully digitized, and they live and work in remote areas
> with poor physical and financial infrastructure.
>
> **THE INNOvATION**\
> Fintech innovation focuses on more efficiently assessing the risk in
> serving smallholder farmers and reducing cost to serve. Agri-focused
> fintechs:
>
> • Leverage technology and employ techniques (e.g., machine learning,
> satellite imagery) to analyze farming practices and ultimately
> determine creditworthiness.
>
> • Partner with actors in the smallholder value chain (e.g.,
> agricultural retailers) to reduce the cost of serving farmers. These
> actors mitigate the risk that a farmer would use a loan for purposes
> other than agriculture by directly offering them credit for seed,
> fertilizer, animal feed, or other agricultural inputs.
>
> • Bundle other services together with credit (e.g., agricultural
> education and advice, insurance, access to markets).
>
> FINTECHS AND UNDERSERVED SEGMENTS

36

> **THE CHALLENGE**\
> New forms of underwriting such as satellite data and value chain
> analysis require patient capital to test and finalize. A balance of
> tech and touch is key to serving this segment, yet a pro-poor approach
> can be expensive, making unit economics difficult from the start and
> some assisted scaling necessary. Agriculture is complex, and many
> investors find it difficult to understand how to get involved and
> receive rewarding returns on investments.
>
> **Ex AMPLE**\
> Crowde is an Indonesian peer-to-peer (P2P) lending platform that
> enables farmers to raise working capital through a crowdfunding
> platform with a profit-sharing scheme. To assess creditworthiness,
> Crowde calculates a farmer's credit score based on the types of crops
> they plant and the strength of their community connections. GPS
> tracking also plays into the credit score. The P2P lending firm
> partners with farm supply stores to deliver loans in the form of
> fertilizer, seed, and animal feed; it does not lend cash. Crowde
> ultimately connects farmers with buyers for their crops. The cycle
> establishes a new infrastructure for the farming industry, providing a
> strong link between farmers, suppliers, and buyers.
>
> **Micro and small enterprises**
>
> **THE PAIN POINT**\
> MSE sale and profit margins are highly vulnerable to factors like
> seasonality, input and labor costs, late payments, and unexpected
> expenses that can result in uneven cash flows. Without collateral or a
> credit history, banks are reluctant to lend to MSEs.
>
> **THE INNOvATION**\
> Fintech lending business models deploy AI, machine learning, and data
> analytics to offer customized working capital loans to MSEs. The
> models assess transactional data (e.g., MSE cashflows, electronic
> invoices) from POS devices or bank statements to assess loan
> applicants. Some models are even able to establish creditworthiness,
> evaluate risk, and issue loans within 24 hours. Access to real-time
> information helps fintech lenders manage risk.
>
> **THE GAP**\
> Fintech lenders need patient capital that allows them to test and
> ensure the models they use to assess creditworthiness and risk are
> reliable---especially those used in remote areas and those that focus
> on excluded customer segments. Regulation in some markets requires
> fintech lenders to hold multiple licenses, resulting in increased
> administrative costs. The availability of reliable, real-time data
> such as electronic transactions or invoices can limit the size of MSEs
> that can be served.

37

> **Ex AMPLE**\
> Indifi, an MSE fintech lender in India, facilitates tailor-made,
> collateral-free small business loans. First, the MSE provides its
> basic business and KYC details. Indifi then uses its advanced
> algorithms on payment and other business data to draw insights and
> judge the creditworthiness of the business. Loans are delivered
> directly through payment gateways according to the customer's needs
> and at customized intervals.
>
> **Women**
>
> **THE PAIN POINT**\
> The stringent requirements of traditional institutions often make it
> difficult for women to access financial services. They may lack ID or
> lack property rights for collateral. Financial products and services
> often are not designed or delivered in a way that encourages adoption
> among women. In addition, disparities in mobile phone ownership and
> literacy levels exacerbate women's financial exclusion.
>
> **THE INNOvATION**\
> Fintech business models areusing technology that allows women to
> bypass inflexible requirements and directly interact with financial
> services.
>
> • Fintech lending business models use digital footprints and alternate
> credit scoring to improve women's creditworthiness or decrease the
> risk of serving them. Fintech companies are capturing digital
> footprints of savings groups and assessing women's social media or
> business data in order to provide women with credit.
>
> • Fintech business models are beginning to deploy technology to design
> and ensure a positive customer experience for women. Some focus
> innovation on women's customer experience by creating apps while
> others design financial products based on women's goals.
>
> **THE GENDER GAP**\
> Even with these innovations, fintech is not a perfect solution to
> resolve the financial inclusion gender gap. Counting on business as
> usual to reach women may not work; a focus on solving for deeper
> social- norms-based issues in product design and delivery is required.
>
> **Ex AMPLE**\
> Amartha, a P2P fintech lending platform in Indonesia, offers rural
> women\
> microentrepreneurs access to working capital. The fintech recognized
> that women in rural Indonesia lack enough capital to support their
> enterprises and traditional lenders have unrealistic collateral
> requirements to serve this customer segment. Amartha utilizes a
> psychometric credit scoring model to assess a borrower's
> creditworthiness and risk. In addition to its digital platform, the
> fintech extends a human touch by employing field officers to educate
> women and disburse loans.
