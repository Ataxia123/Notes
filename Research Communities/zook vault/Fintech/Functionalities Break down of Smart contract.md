The _LudusSocialGraph_ contract could work with other applications that want to upload match results to the social graph in several ways, such as:

- **Athlete Performance-based Popularity:** Applications that post match results can trigger responses in the _LudusSocialGraph_ contract. For instance, if an athlete has an exceptional performance in a game, the application can call the `lensFollowAthlete` function to simulate a surge in the athlete's followers.

- **Integration through Athlete Profiles:** The profile information found in the `lensGetAthlete` function can be used by other apps to display comprehensive athlete profiles. Linking this with match results could provide fans with a holistic view of an athlete's performance and popularity.

- **Engagement Metrics:** The follower data from `lensGetFollowerCount` and `lensIsFollowing` can be used by other applications to determine fan engagement or popularity metrics, which could be tied to match performances.
