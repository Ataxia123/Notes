>
> The monumental challenges we face today, from COVID-19 (coronavirus)
> to the war in Ukraine, have reminded us that throughout history,
> turbulent times are often accompanied by innovation.
>
> The technology-enabled innovation in financial services---known as
> *fintech*---is one such example, accelerating rapidly as pandemic
> shutdowns amplified its importance for maintaining business activity
> and financial services during a time of social distancing.
>
> Every day, headlines attest to the seismic shifts that fintech is
> bringing to the financial services industry, driven by a dramatic
> expansion of internet access and smartphone use, combined with
> lower-cost computing and data storage. As financial products,
> payments, and business models evolve---even the concept of money
> itself---so too are market players and the structure of the markets in
> which they compete. Large telecommunications and information
> technology compa-nies, retail chains, and small start-up companies are
> joining traditional banks and nonfinancial institutions in providing
> services.
>
> Digital financial services can play a significant role in maintaining
> active credit markets to support a resilient and inclusive recovery,
> leveraging data, ana-lytics, and new business models such as embedded
> finance. They can also create new opportunities to make the global
> financial system more efficient and inclu-sive by overcoming
> geographic and physical obstacles to services and by making
> information more widely available to consumers and providers.
>
> Policy makers globally have embraced fintech development to promote
> inno-vation and growth of the digital economy. For regulators and

The latest World Bank Global Findex data show that global financial
account own-ership grew from 51 percent of the adult population in 2011
to 76 percent in 2021. Access to basic financial services such as
savings, insurance, and credit translates into better firm productivity
and growth for micro and small businesses, as well as higher incomes and
resilience, to improve the lives of the poor. Yet too many people and
firms still lack access to essential financial services that could help
them thrive.

> regulators to be proactive, pragmatic, and clear in their decisions.
>
> • *Broaden monitoring horizons and reassess regulatory
> perimeters.*Financial services are increasingly provided by a wide
> variety of entities and are even embedded into commercial transactions
> and social interactions. These devel-opments blur the boundaries of
> the financial sector. It is essential to proac-tively monitor the
> comprehensive financial sector value chain and reshape the regulatory
> perimeter accordingly.
>
> • *Review regulatory, supervisory, and oversight frameworks.* The
> range of new products and providers, the use of new technologies and a
> wider range of data, and the inclusion of new customer segments in
> increasingly complex markets has made existing regulatory and
> supervisory mandates and approaches insuf-ficient. Principles that
> help underpin policies include pursuing an approach that is
> proportional to risks; maintaining a level playing field by treating
> the same activities and risks similarly, looking through technology
> and focusing on underlying economic functions; and ensuring the
> primacy of core policy objec-tives. This may call for tailored
> approaches that are entity based.
>
> • *Be mindful of evolving policy trade-offs as fintech adoption

> stability, competition, concentration, efficiency, and inclusion
> through vari-ous actions, including:
>
> • Formulating data collection principles and proactively monitoring
> market conduct
>
> • Establishing frameworks for open banking and data ownership
>
> • Revisiting restrictions on product tying and linkages between
> banking and commerce.

• *Monitor market structure and conduct to maintain competition.* The
initial focus of many regulators has been on facilitating market entry
since small start-ups and new entrants have been driving the momentum of
innovation. However, the industry is rapidly boomeranging toward
concentration of play-ers and platforms because of the economies of
scale and the massive amounts of data held by Big Tech companies. These
developments may deliver inclu-sion and efficiency, particularly in low-
and middle-income economies that may lack a robust, competitive, and
inclusive banking sector. However, regu-lators will need to proactively
monitor markets and dynamically balance trade-offs between competition,
concentration, efficiency, data protection, and inclusion.

• *Modernize and open financial infrastructure.*Financial infrastructure
may need upgrading to enable digital products and services.
Infrastructure should be interoperable and open to both new and
traditional players. The increasing role of fintech companies, embedded
finance by Big Tech companies, digital money, and cross-border financial
flows will pressure regulators to ensure that the access policies of
financial infrastructures are fair and transparent. Moreover, with the
entry of new market-level services that take on character-istics of
financial infrastructures, regulators will need to assess whether and
how to bring them within the regulatory perimeter.

• *Ensure that public money remains fit for the digital world.*Reduced
reliance on public money could impede authorities from shaping and
safeguarding finan-cial sector and economic development. The ongoing
digitization of the econ-omy and payments, the world of crypto-assets,
and the influence of Big Tech firms in payments and user data, over
time, could challenge the role of public money, competition, and
privacy. Public authorities might consider distinct, public alternatives
to crypto-assets, such as central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), in
addition to strengthening policy frameworks regarding crypto-assets and
Big Tech firms. Countries that consider creating a CBDC should carefully
evaluate the wide-ranging implications and design options in
consultation with public and private stakeholders.

• *Pursue strong cross-border coordination and sharing of information
and best practices.*Fintech developments enable providers to reach a
wide set of cus-tomers across borders and provide services without
necessarily being subject to regulation in the customer's jurisdiction.
Regulators and public authorities need to collaborate and coordinate
with their peers to safeguard their respec-tive financial systems and
customers.

**Overview**

**Introduction**

The ongoing digitization of financial services and money creates
opportunities to build more inclusive and efficient financial services
and promote economic devel-opment. Countries should embrace these
opportunities and implement policies that enable and encourage safe
financial innovation and adoption. Technological advances are blurring
the boundaries of both financial firms and the financial sector. New
infrastructures, providers, products, business models, and market
structures are shaping market outcomes in profound ways. As such, it is
necessary to ensure that market outcomes remain aligned with core policy
objectives as the financial sector continues to transform and policy
trade-offs evolve.

This flagship publication explores the implications of financial
technology (fintech)and the digital transformation of financial services
for market out-comes, on the one hand, and the regulation and
supervision of financial services, on the other hand, and explores how
these interact. It provides a high-level per-spective for senior policy
makers and is accompanied by a set of technical notes that focus in
detail on selected salient issues for a more technical audience (as
listed and summarized in appendix B of this publication). Figure O.1
lays down a conceptual framework for fintech and the interactions
betweenmarkets, policy, and development.

> **The Fundamental Drivers of Fintech**
>
> Technology-enabled innovation in financial services---fintech---is
> reshaping finan-cial products, payments, business models, market
> players, market structure, and even money itself. This is a global
> phenomenon, especially in the realm of pay-ments, according to the
> global patterns examined in the Fintech Activity Note developed for
> this publication (Didier et al. 2022). The adoption of fintech was
> accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic (further discussed in appendix
> C).

**2** Fintech and the Future of Finance

Fintech adoption can further financial development by promoting core
policy objectives such as financial stability, integrity, inclusion,
efficiency, innovation, and competition, and it can provide the firm
foundations needed for the digital economy to flourish. Fintech-enabled
business models and products can support economies to become more
resilient and promote an equitable recovery from the pandemic (World
Bank 2022). At the same time, a balanced policy approach is required to
mitigate various risks related to, among others, financial stability and
integrity, consumer and investor protection, fair competition, and data
privacy---further addressed in the Consumer Protection Note prepared for
this publica-tion (Boeddu and Chien 2022).

The two fundamental drivers of this wave of fintech are (a) ubiquitous
connectivity through mobile, internet-connected devices and
communication networks; and (b) low-cost computing and data storage.
Together, these enable new business models for the delivery of
technology such as cloud computing. Applications leveraging these
advances, such as e-commerce and mobile apps, create reams of Big Data
about users and transactions. Low-cost computing and storage allow that
data to be mined for insights.

**Reducing frictions in financial services.** These drivers---data and
connectivity---can alleviate key frictions in the provision of financial
services, such as information asymmetries and transactions costs. They
have therefore enabled a wide range of data-driven process automation
and product applica-tions, from credit and insurance underwriting to
investment robo-advisors.

Data-driven business models are able to scale rapidly, leveraging
positive feedback loops from customer activity that generates data that
are used to pro-vide additional services, which, in turn, generate more
user engagement and data. Lenders that previously relied on a borrower's
credit history or collateral to fill information gaps about cash flows
and ability to repay can now use data-driven credit scores and real-time
payments data on cash flows to extend credit to previously underserved
individuals and small and medium enterprises (SMEs), reaching them at a
lower cost through mobile channels.

**Atomizing the value chain.** These drivers also enable the
reconfiguration of the value chains that produce financial
services.Transaction costs and barriers to information flows have long
defined the scope of what was produced within a single firm; reduced
transaction costs and friction-free information flows allow a
reconfiguration of financial services value chains and product bundles.
Connectivity and data exchange allow a product or service to be broken
up into distinct components (atomization) that can be offered by
different providers and recombined in new ways.

Account opening, for example, has moved from being a single-provider
ser-vice delivered at the bank branch, using its own front and back
offices, to a range of potential configurations. Now, a bank account
might be opened either through its physical locations or through the
mobile app of a partner such as a retailer or an e-commerce platform,
with identification (ID) verification provided by a spe-cialized
fintech, the ledger sitting on an outsourced cloud-based information
technology (IT) infrastructure, and customer service provided by an
offshore call center. That account might be branded as a bank product,
or it might be delivered by the partner as a service "powered by" the
partner with the consumer barely aware of the underlying financial
institution.

Overview **3**

> **Unbundling and rebundling services.** The ability of customers and
> provid-ers to access information and move funds more easily has
> enabled the unbun-dling of financial services: specialized providers
> offer single products, and customers can choose a set of service
> providers that collectively meets their needs. Rather than using the
> deposit, payment, and loan products of a single institution, customers
> can choose to keep deposits in one place (or more), shop around for
> the best loan offer, and use different payments providers for
> different uses---paying bills, splitting a restaurant bill, or sending
> money overseas. Customers can now assemble their own sets of services
> and bundle them at the level of app icons on a smartphone screen.
>
> Critically, the same advances in computing power, data, and
> connectivity allow service providers---which do not own the whole
> customer financial rela-tionship (as banks once did)---to provide
> single solutions and new packages of financial services or to rebundle
> financial services with other business or com-mercial activities.
>
> **Reshaping business models.** Atomization, unbundling, and rebundling

**4** Fintech and the Future of Finance

**New Financial Infrastructures**\
Digital transformation creates a need for new infrastructures---such as
fast payment systems, digital ID, and data exchange platforms---to
support the other market outcomes. It also provides new ways to meet
that need. The impact of changing financial infrastructure may be
largest in EMDEs, where prior infrastructures are most lacking.
Financial infrastructures are no longer the sole purview of the central
bank, incumbent payment system operators, and autho-rized credit bureaus
or asset registries.

In more developed markets, advances in connectivity between bank systems
have enabled faster payments, and these advances are now increasingly
being adopted in EMDEs as well. Further, in EMDEs, mobile money systems
are filling a gap in access to retail accounts and payments, enabling
individuals to easily transact at a distance and SMEs to accept digital
payments, as discussed in detail in the Payments Note developed for this
publication (Delort and Garcia Luna 2022). Mobile money systems have
become a significant component of the pay-ments landscape and are taking
on some of the functions usually associated with financial
infrastructure.

In Estonia and India, government-provided digital IDs have become part
of the foundational infrastructure for access to financial and other
services. In most countries, digital ID-verification services are
layered on top of existing nondigital government IDs by private sector
innovators. Technology has expanded the potential coverage and impact of
other existing infrastructures as well, such as credit information and
collateral registries.

Further, technological developments have opened the door for new quasi-
infrastructure solutions, including innovative providers of alternative
data credit scoring and industry-led factoring and reverse factoring
platforms. As technol-ogy enables a broader range of providers to offer
financial services, both tradi-tional financial infrastructures and
quasi-financial infrastructures play essential roles for new entrants
and incumbents seeking to participate in the market--- giving rise,
however, to potential challenges related to competition, pricing, and
fair access.

**Innovation in Both Broadened and Niche Markets**\
Technology enables providers to serve and profit from broader markets as
well as defined market segments. Digital channels for financial services
enable providers to reach a broader market without the need for a
high-cost branch infrastructure. The low-cost reach of digital banks
paired with customers' ability to search digi-tally for services enables
focused providers to find and serve a dispersed niche customer segment.
Automated data-driven processes can serve low-value, high-volume
segments efficiently and profitably.

Products also can be configured and tailored to meet the specific needs
of a particular consumer or business segment, enabling, for example, the
provision to SMEs of products like trade finance, invoice discounting,
and foreign exchange services that were once reserved for high-volume
large corporates, as found in the SME Note prepared for this publication
(Teima et al. 2022). Moreover, the growth of affinity digital banks
serving the specific needs of segments---such as

**6** Fintech and the Future of Finance

Crypto-assets, including stablecoins and DeFi, are distributed ledger
tech-nology (DLT)-based, decentralized forms of digital value and
financial ser-vices that aim to serve a range of economic functions.
They hold promise for financial innovation, inclusion, efficiency,
capital formation, and transparency. For example, they could improve the
speed and cost of cross-border payments and remittances, which are key
for EMDEs. However, these new technologies carry significant risks
related to, among others, financial integrity, consumer and investor
protection, financial stability, fair competition, and monetary
sov-ereignty.

**Policy Objectives and Roles for Policy Makers**

Allowing fintech developments to be driven solely by market forces may
ultimately not serve core policy objectives. These objectives include
promoting financial innovation, efficiency, and inclusion while
mitigating risks associated with finan-cial stability and integrity;
cyber and operational risks; data, consumer, and inves-tor protection;
fair competition; and cross-border regulatory arbitrage.

The technology that enables niche providers to be economically viable by
targeting a particular product or segment does not ensure open and
competitive markets. The simultaneoustendency toward market
concentration, particularly due to economies of scale and network
effects in data, raises concerns about potential anticompetitive
conduct, even as it may also deliver inclusion and efficiency,
particularly in developing economies that lack competitive and inclusive
financial sectors. A concentrated provider or a Big Tech crossing over
into finance may provide financial services that are otherwise
unavailable. Consumers can benefit from a wave of fintech-induced
innovation and competition even as markets become more concentrated. In
this environment, proper policy safeguards become increasingly important
for maintaining fair competition and preventing abuse of market power.
Similarly, crypto-assets and DeFi ecosystems could reduce costs and spur
innovation, but they currently lack transparency and adequate investor,
consumer, and financial integrity protections.

**Balancing the Trade-Offs**\
Policy trade-offs may evolve as fintech adoption increases.This dynamic
can make it more challenging to ensure that market outcomes remain
aligned with core pol-icy objectives. At lower levels of fintech
development, providing basic policy sup-port for innovation and
mitigating immediate risks---such as illicit activity and protection of
customer funds---may yield good short-term outcomes as policy makers aim
to reap innovation, inclusion, and efficiency gains.

Consumers have benefited from a wave of fintech-induced innovation and
competition even as markets have become more concentrated. Policy
makers, however, must remain aware that adoption can increase rapidly;
they will need to improve their monitoring tools and be ready to step
in. Strengthening or clar-ifying policy frameworks and improving
financial infrastructures become increasingly important to continuing to
safely support fintech adoption as (a) fintech reaches more consumers,
increasing its volume and dependence on user data, and (b) certain
providers reach scale.

**8** Fintech and the Future of Finance

primacy of public money, with implications for, among other things,
monetary policy and financial stability.

Some authorities have also noted the concentration, data protection, and
pri-vacy risks that large-scale payment service providers can pose,
particularly the ones employing a data monetization-led business
strategy. It is perceived that a CBDC, being a digital version of fiat
currency, could imbue public money with the necessary digital features
and enable it to provide a safer and efficient alter-native to society
while promoting competition and innovation.The perceived potential of
CBDCs to advance financial inclusion is also of interest to some pub-lic
authorities, notably the EMDEs. However, CBDCs are not a panacea for
financial inclusion since key behavioral, technological, and
infrastructural barri-ers faced by other digital payment solutions may
remain in place.

Several jurisdictions and international standard-setting bodies are
studying design options and developing road maps to introduce CBDCs
(Kosse and Mattei 2022). The scale and pace of adoption and implications
are not fully clear at this point, but the general thrust appears to
position CBDCs as coexisting with other forms of money and payment
mechanisms. The use of CBDCs could either be limited to regulated
financial-sector players (wholesale) or open to all (retail).

Wholesale CBDCs, given their limited use, do not pose any significant
policy challenges. A retail CBDC may, however, hinder bank funding and
credit inter-mediation, reduce monetary stability, distort the level
playing field, and raise financial integrity and data privacy
challenges. As such, policy makers must give careful attention to
various implementation options related to, for example, dis-tribution,
wallet limits, remuneration, privacy features, onboarding, and
verifi-cation mechanisms.

At the time of writing, The Bahamas, the Eastern Caribbean Central Bank,
and Nigeria have already launched retail CBDCs, with a few more in
advanced stages: China, Ghana, and Jamaica have launched large-scale
live testing. The guidance emerging from standard-setting
bodies---notably, the Committee on Payments and Market Structures (CPMI)
of the Bank for International Settlements---calls for striking a
balanced approach. This approach would likely translate to retail CBDCs
being distributed through regulated banks and pay-ment service
providers, being interoperable and coexisting with private money, and
being subject to limits on transactions and restrictions on cross-border
use.

Policy makers are also actively pursuing other avenues to advance the
reach and efficiency of payment systems. The reforms being pursued
include imple-menting fast payment systems, expanding access to payment
systems to nonbank entrants, promoting open banking, extending hours of
operations, and expanding direct access to central bank settlement
services to non bank institutions. These reforms could also enable the
smoother introduction of CBDCs at a later stage.

**Attending to Regulatory and Supervisory Frameworks**\
The cross-sectoral nature of fintech has profound implications for
regulatory frameworks. The growing diversity of financial service
providers resulting from atomization and unbundling requires the
reevaluation of the regulatory perimeter, as further examined in chapter
5 and the Regulation Note (Gispert et al. 2022).

Regulators are confronted with three questions: what to regulate, when
to regulate, and how to regulate. Finance has long been intertwined with
other commercial activities. Long-standing practices related to payment
terms for

This publication is part of an ongoing research, advisory, and
investment agenda; it builds on prior research and work in this space by
practitioners from the World Bank Group and other institutions and
firms. Prior work has included the Bali Fintech Agenda; advisory and
policy work with governments, regulators, and standard-setting bodies;
World Bank--International Monetary Fund (IMF) Financial Sector
Assessment Program (FSAP) analyses of fintech developments; and the
accumulated experience of the International Finance Corporation (IFC) as
a pioneer investor in emerging markets' fintech. This publication
leverages a unique data set of fintech adoption metrics; a global survey
of banks, multilateral financial institutions, nonbank financial
institutions, fintech companies, and oth-ers; and the experience of
global fintech, finance, and regulatory experts.

The World Bank continues to assess fintech developments and advise
govern-ments and central banks on fintech issues in coordination with
the IMF, the Financial Stability Board (FSB), the Committee on Payments
and Market Infrastructures, the Group of Twenty (G-20), the Global
Partnership for Financial Inclusion, and other relevant organizations.
IFC is complementing its invest-ment in fintech firms and the digital
transformation of traditional financial insti-tutions with research and
thought leadership on the private sector growth and investment
opportunities emerging from fintech adoption, including in areas such as
small and medium enterprise (SME) finance and embedded finance.

**Conceptual Framework**

This publication is framed around the development of and interactions
between four key factors that are relevant for fintech: fundamental
fintech developments or drivers; market outcomes; core policy
objectives; and policy making (figure 1.1). This conceptual framework
captures the implications of fintech and the digital transformation
under way in financial services for (a) market outcomes (summa-rized in
the top portion of figure 1.1), and (b) policy making (in the bottom
portion)---and how these two aspects interact. The impact of fintech
drivers on market outcomes typically requires a policy response to
ensure alignment with policy objectives, which in turn shapes market
outcomes, producing a feedback loop.

Within this framework, fundamental technology developments shape market
outcomes. Advances in computation and connectivity have produced massive
amounts of data and alleviated transaction costs as well as frictions
associated with financial services provision. These technological
factors---combined with scale and scope economies and network
effects---have profoundly transformed financial sector business models,
products, infrastructures, market players, and market structures. These
technological innovations are ultimately not purely exogenous, because
innovators respond to market conditions and create the next generation
of technologies.

Another key factor involves the core policy objectives---such as
financial inclusion, efficiency, and stability---that drive the
formulation of regulatory and supervisory frameworks. This publication
distinguishes long-standing policy objectives, but these too are not
immutable. For example, financial inclusion and consumer data protection
have emerged relatively recently as policy objectives

**16** Fintech and the Future of Finance

prevent effective monitoring of risks, safeguarding the most vulnerable
custom-ers, and ensuring that financial integrity objectives are met are
key priorities because risks to financial stability, fair competition,
and overall consumer and investor protection are still relatively low.
However, as scale, complexity, inter-connectedness, and possible
concentration increase, policy makers must increase their focus on
safeguarding financial stability, data protection, and fair
competi-tion. This enhanced focus requires that legal, regulatory, and
supervisory frame-works---as well as technology and financial
infrastructures---be reviewed and strengthened to support the
development of a flourishing fintech ecosystem that remains consistent
with policy objectives.

**Fintech: What It Is and Why It Matters**

Fintech can be defined in various ways. The Bali Fintech Agenda, the
FSB, and others broadly define fintech as "advances in technology that
have the potential to transform the provision of financial services
spurring the development of new business models, applications,
processes, and products" (IMF and World Bank 2019).[2]{.underline} The
accompanying technical notes (summarized in appendix B) address specific
technologies, where relevant. The overall focus here, however, is on the
market trends and regulatory implications of the digital transformation
of finance in the context of rapidly digitizing economies, rather than
on specific technologies that may have currency today but may be
superseded tomorrow. For that reason, this publication starts its
analysis with the key drivers of change on the technology side and links
these to the underlying economics of financial intermediation: the
economic frictions that gave rise to intermediaries as well as the
economic forces that shaped their scope and scale.

Technology can lower costs and increase the speed, transparency,
security, and availability of more tailored financial services.
Digitization can reduce fric-tions in each step along the financial
service life cycle, from opening an account to conducting customer due
diligence; authenticating transactions; and auto-mating other,
product-specific processes such as assessing creditworthiness. Fintech
is therefore characterized by low marginal costs per account or
transac-tion and scale efficiencies. Fintech can also enhance
transparency and reduce information asymmetries, since digital processes
generate a data trail, which can be used to better understand consumers,
improve products, manage risks, and promote regulatory compliance.

**History and Context**\
The use of technology in finance has a long history. In fact, because
finance involves high-value activities, there has always been an
incentive to use the latest technology---whether it was the finest scale
to weigh gold pieces or the fastest communication methods of the day,
from Rothschild's carrier pigeons to Reuter's telegraph. Digital
technology made its way into finance as the second major appli-cation of
electronic computers after the military.

The first wave of financial technology in the 1950s to 1970s saw
mainframe computer systems become part of the fabric of the back office,
moving gradually to the middle and front offices of most large financial
institutions. The late 1960s through the 1980s saw the emergence of
digital technology companies dedicated to serving financial
institutions, including core banking system providers like

**24** Fintech and the Future of Finance

> CHAPTER 2
>
> **Fundamental Drivers of Fintech**
>
> **Key Technologies: Connectivity and Computing Power**
>
> Digital technology is reshaping financial services by eliminating many
> of the frictions that drove earlier integrated business models through
> advances in two key areas: connectivity and computing power. The
> internet and mobile technology have increased connectivity among
> consumers, financial services providers, and a range of intermediate
> service providers and customer interfaces.[1]{.underline} Ubiquitous
> connectivity has eliminated barriers and reduced costs for information
> transfer and remote interactions. In emerging markets and developing
> economies (EMDEs), where barriers to financial access and costs of
> services have been high, mobile connectivity has enabled markets to
> leapfrog past the constraints of fixed line and bank branch
> infrastructure. Basic access through at least a feature phone is
> available to billions of individuals across markets. Low-cost
> computing and data storage put processing power such as smartphones at
> the end of each of those ubiquitous connection points, enabling
> complex transactions and services; generating vast amounts of data;
> and facilitating the efficient processing, storage, and analysis of
> that data.
>
> The resulting digitization of a broad range of activities, including
> finance, is creating massive volumes of data that can be leveraged to
> broaden and deepen financial services and better manage risk. A
> variety of sources generate these data, including the location and
> usage data from mobile phones, the contact information from social

> companies, and the sales data from retail outlets and payments
> networks. Such data are being used in a wide range of traditional
> financial services and new types of businesses to improve credit
> analysis, process efficiency, risk management, product design,
> customer service, and other areas. Advances in analytics---including
> artificial intelligence---enable automation, process improvements, and
> new approaches to risk management.
>
> Together, ubiquitous connectivity and scalable computing and data
> storage enable the development of cloud-based computing and data
> storage infrastructure. The result is an ability to increase
> processing efficiency, to gather and analyze large data sets, to
> obtain infrastructure on demand, and to reduce the fixed cost barrier
> to entry in financial services and other industries. Combined with
> software as a service (SaaS)[2]{.underline} and cloud-based analytics
> offerings, niche-focused financial services can be viable at low
> volumes and can scale as they grow their customer base. Most fintech
> start-ups use cloud-based services to keep their own infrastructure
> cost low and leverage the scalable and data analytics capabilities of
> the large cloud providers. At the same time, digitization of processes
> creates more digitally available data, and scalable infrastructure
> allows reams of data to be stored and analyzed.
>
> Another result of these technology advances has been the emergence of
> platform-based business models in e-commerce and social media markets.
> These businesses leverage the connectivity of individuals and
> businesses as well as the ability to quickly and easily collaborate,
> discover counterparties, and package and deliver a range of digital
> and physical goods and services. Such business models benefit from
> strong network effects. Adding users on one side of a platform market
> (ride-hailing drivers, for example) creates more value to users on the
> other side (riders). The platform becomes more attractive on the first
> side (drivers), attracting even more users. In addition to the
> presence of a diverse set of counterparties, more participation allows
> the platform to mine more data about users, behaviors, and
> preferences; to create better matches; or to better tailor its own
> products and services. A positive growth spiral can result in a
> "winner-takes-all" type of outcome, where all market participants want
> to benefit from the network effects of being on the same platform.
>
> Platform business models that aggregate and link buyers and sellers
> are also being adopted for price comparison, distribution, and
> origination of financial products like lending, investment, and
> insurance---in some cases, by the same real-sector platforms
> discussed. The platform operators are embedding financial services to
> improve the experience of their different customer constituencies. For
> example, ride-hailing services in many countries provide payment
> services to improve the safety and efficiency of the payment process
> for both drivers and riders, and they also seek to facilitate drivers'
> access to insurance and to credit to purchase and maintain their
> vehicles.
>
> **Impact of Technology**
>
> The technological advances described have affected every industry, and
> their impacts on financial services have been particularly
> profound.Many aspects of finance were already digitized behind the
> scenes; most of the value of global pay-ment flows, for example, were
> already executed through computer-to-computer transactions. This wave
> of technology has resulted in the unbundling of financial

products, the reconfiguration of the value chains that produce and
deliver finan-cial products and services, and the entry of new
providers.

The initial impacts were disaggregation and atomization at the product
level and the potential for a much more fragmented financial services
sector at the pro-vider level. However, as explained in the following
section, "Impact of Economic Forces: Scale Economies, Frictions, and
Rebundling," traditional economic forces that shape industry
structure---such as economies of scale and scope, search costs, and
transaction frictions---remain relevant, albeit in new forms. These
forces counterbalance the tendency toward fragmentation; they are, in
fact, driving a rebundling of services and potential acceleration of
sector concentration.

**Unbundling and Reconfiguration of Value Chains**\
The application of technological advances to producing financial
services allevi-ates fixed-cost constraints as well as frictions related
to transaction costs and incomplete information. Increased connectivity
and cloud-based computing allow new entrants to reach customers without
investment in traditional branch and data center infrastructure.
Connectivity and vast amounts of user data can increase transparency and
trust while also improving credit assessment, thereby reducing the risk
cost of lending.

The potential to transfer data between different providers at different
points in the production of a financial service enables disaggregation
and reconfiguration of value chains. Vertical integration of activities
within a single firm is a means of avoiding the transaction costs of
working across multiple suppliers and producers to assemble product
through market-mediated exchanges of goods or services (Coase 1937;
Williamson 1975). Digital connectivity and rich data sharing reduce or
eliminate many of the transaction and monitoring costs of
market-mediated exchanges, obviating the need for vertical integration.

A producer can use outsourcing and partnership arrangements to unbundle
products and incorporate atomized solutions from specialist providers of
com-ponent products, subprocesses, or functions. Financial institutions
increasingly use specialist providers for customer onboarding;
verification and Know Your Customer (KYC) procedures; credit scoring;
loan processing; and other services provided under their own brands.
These institutions partner with consumer- facing fintech firms and other
new brands where they do not have their own products. Interoperable
payment systems, application programming interfaces (APIs), and
open-banking protocols have made it even easier to knit together
services from different providers. In this way, data, analytics, and
automation can result in market demand being met more fully---that is,
they can create more complete markets---by enabling the tailoring of
products and services to the needs of well-defined customer segments or
even each individual consumer.

Technology developments, accompanied by enabling regulatory frameworks,
have allowed for the separation of payment services from the maintenance
of accounts. Specifically, e-money created a payment service distinct
from a bank account, hence enabling nonbank entities to enter the
payment services business. And "open banking" is enabling third-party
applications to initiate payment transactions without even having to
maintain any account, taking unbundling even further. These advances
reducethe barriers to entry for new providers, including providers of
new platform-based business models,[3]{.underline} and enable closer
integration between financial services and real-sector economic
interactions

> (embedded finance). The ongoing development of decentralized finance
> (DeFi) takes this to an extreme by not requiring an account-holding
> institution for transaction processing or other functions.
>
> As a result, it is increasingly easy for customers to engage in
> horizontal unbundling by choosing different providers of their
> preferred sets of services. For example, consumers may have their
> salaries deposited to bank accounts; automatically transfer portions
> for day-to-day spending to neobanks (companies offering bank-like
> services)[4]{.underline} that offer cards with attractive budget
> tracking fea-tures; use a specialist remittance app for foreign
> transfers; and invest via one or more other providers, from
> peer-to-peer (P2P) lending to social stock-picking apps. Internet
> connectivity reduces the cost of searching for preferred products and
> the barriers to moving funds between them. The ease of transferring
> between accounts and providers allows customers to re-create the full
> set of an integrated financial services provider on their smartphone
> screens.
>
> **New Entrants**\
> Digital innovation has reduced cost barriers, allowing the entry of
> more new players.New entrants do not require investment in physical
> access points such as branches, automated teller machines (ATMs), or
> agents. Although "phygital" com-binations of digital and physical
> infrastructure continue to be needed to serve cus-tomers (even
> crypto-assets users were offered bitcoin ATMs), the increased
> interoperability and ease of outsourcing arrangements described
> earlier enable providers without physical networks to partner with
> others to offer those services, where required. Physical networks
> require scale and capillarity, but a few agent, branch, and ATM
> networks can serve a market without every provider creating and
> maintaining one.
>
> The current wave of fintech innovation is marked by the entry of
> start-ups (fintech firms), on the one hand, and large incumbent
> technology companies (Big Tech firms) on the other hand. The former
> are often well resourced given active venture capital interest, but
> they lack the benefit of an existing customer base and often employ
> aggressive approaches to take market share from incum-bents on
> specific products. Firms in the latter category have the advantage of
> existing customer bases and revenue streams, which they can leverage
> to scale rapidly and integrate financial services into existing
> products and services. Different types of entrants can have very
> different implications for market struc-ture---with, in turn,
> different implications for financial regulation, competition, and
> consumer protection policies.
>
> Niche providers can offer tailored products and services and find an
> inter-ested customer base. Although they must still develop a trusted
> reputation, the elimination of many fixed costs and a reduction in
> variable and switching costs make it economically viable for a
> low-cost provider to enter the market. However, risks and economic
> forces are more stubborn than costs. Credit, liquidity, mar-ket, and
> operational risks can be reduced or transferred but not eliminated
> com-pletely. The attack surface for cybercriminals has become larger

core relationship (Feyen et al. 2022). Of the respondents, 36 percent
expect customers to use multiple providers with no core relationship,
and 16 percent expect that customers will have a core relationship with
a marketplace or platform provider (figure 2.1).

**Impact of Economic Forces: Scale Economies, Frictions, and
Rebundling**

Amid the entry of new niche players and shifts in business models,
economies of scale and scope remain relevant. The minimum scale for
efficient service delivery is now lower for financial service providers
that use variable infrastructure services like cloud computing. This,
however, simply shifts the scale effects to the new infrastructure
providers; as such, scale remains highly relevant in areas of cloud
computing, data processing, and software platforms. In fact, new forms
of scale economies have emerged in connectivity (network effects) and
all aspects of data provision and services alongside conventional
economies of scale in capital, including reputation or "trust capital."
A provider's customer acquisition and funding costs also create
economies of scope: a niche provider that has a cost of customer
acquisition can only amortize that cost

> CHAPTER 3
>
> **Market Outcomes**
>
> **Impacts across the Four Dimensions of Market Outcomes**
>
> The conceptual framework shown in chapter 1 specified four dimensions
> of fintech's market outcomes: business models and products, market
> players, market structure, and financial infrastructures. Two types of
> transformative fintech innovations---digital payments and digital
> lending---are reshaping all of these four dimensions, and certain
> policy issues have emerged as a result.
>
> **Digital Payments**\
> Globally, an estimated 770 billion digital payments were made in 2020
> (Capgemini Research Institute 2021). Mobile money transactions alone
> numbered 41 billion, representing a total transaction value of US\$767
> billion across 300 million active mobile money accounts (GSMA 2020).
> Sub-Saharan Africa accounted for the bulk of mobile money transactions
> in 2020---27.4 billion transactions, amounting to US\$490 billion
> across 159 million active mobile money accounts (GSMA 2021b). The
> volume of digital payments is growing at around 11 percent a year
> globally and at much higher rates in emerging markets and developing
> economies (EMDEs) (Capgemini 2020).
>
> E-money issued by nonbanks, such as mobile network operators,
> leveraged the connectivity boom and has enabled millions of users to
> store value and make transactions from their phones, most notably in
> Sub-Saharan Africa. As users increasingly shift to smartphone use from
> basic phones, app-based payments can replace Unstructured
> Supplementary Service Data(USSD) interfaces, offering enhanced
> functionality (including linkage to bank accounts), speed, and
> conve-nience while also generating rich data that can be used for
> further services.[1]{.underline}
>
> Market Outcomes **33**
>
> A next generation of digital money is emerging in the form of
> crypto-assets and central bank digital currencies (CBDCs). Many EMDEs
> are looking into issuing CBDCs, in part to support the digital
> economy, improve payments efficiency, and promote financial inclusion.
> CBDCs, however, share many of the same challenges as traditional
> approaches to reaching and serving unbanked customers and, as such,
> are not a panacea for these policy objectives. Further, in addition to
> the proven models of e-money and agent-based basic banking models, new
> developments like faster payment systems, quick response (QR) codes,
> and open banking could provide alternative pathways.
>
> In light of their scale, mobile money networks raise policy issues
> related to competition and how authorities would deal with the failure
> of a large, systemi-cally important nonbank e-money issuer. Depending
> on how it is implemented, a CBDC may reducebank deposits and credit
> intermediation and may distort the playing field on which banks and
> private payment service providers compete. In EMDEs, foreign CBDCs
> could displace local currencies and erode monetary sovereignty.
>
> Figure 3.1 summarizes how the ongoing digital transformation of money
> and payments is reshaping financial market outcomes in each of the
> four dimensions.
>
> **Digital Lending**\
> Providing credit through digital channels and using data-driven
> underwriting and risk management have been important fintech
> applications. The flow of digital credit was estimated at almost
> US\$800 billion globally in 2020, with Big Tech lending platforms
> representing 70 percent of this lending volume (Cornelli et al. 2020;
> Cornelli et al. 2021).
>
> Peer-to-peer (P2P) lending, an early alternative credit innovation,
> was as much a regulatory arbitrage to gather nondeposit funding as it
> was a means to leverage alternative data (the "wisdom of the crowd")
> for underwriting. Digital lenders use enhanced reach and data
> analytics to increase access to finance to individuals and small and
> medium enterprises (SMEs) that had been previously excluded for lack
> of proximity to a branch or lack of credit history. Embedded finance
> providers ranging from e-commerce and logistics platforms to consumer
> goods distribution networks can leverage transactional data on orders,
> inven-tory, sales, or receivables to provide working capital.
>
> However, the wide range of alternative credit providers raises policy
> issues over how to treat nonbank lenders---such as whether lending is
> a regulated activ-ity per se or should only be regulated in the
> context of protecting depositors or investors. It also raises issues
> regarding consumer protection of the borrower (for example, usury
> limits and fair disclosure) and credit information sharing with and by
> nonbank lenders. New technologies and data-based lending also raise
> policy issues concerning algorithmic bias, digital exclusion, and data
> pri-vacy. In addition, the remote nature of many of these products
> raises challenges for Know Your Customer (KYC) practices, gauging of
> product appropriateness, and consumer disclosures and education.
> Finally, significant growth of digital lending could have implications
> for monetary policy management if alternative lenders are less
> directly affected by standard policy levers.
>
> Figure 3.2 summarizes how the ongoing digital transformation of
> lending is reshaping the four dimensions of market outcomes.

**Impacts of Other Fintech Applications**\
Beyond these two illustrative examples---of digital payments and digital
lending---other applications of fintech also affect the financial
infrastructure, business models and products, market players, and market
structures in their respective markets. Among them is insurtech:
technological innovations that improve the efficiency of the insurance
industry. Although insurtech is now a smaller market than digital
payments and credit, it too is shifting the market structure of
produc-ers, brokers, and agents---as well as how policies are
underwritten and claims serviced---using data and Internet of Things
connectivity.

In addition, digital wealth management and investment applications have
broadened access to products and encouraged more active participation by
retail

**36** Fintech and the Future of Finance

Now that fintech's cross-cutting impacts on the various dimensions of
market outcomes have been discussed, this chapter turns to the impacts
on each of the four market dimensions.

**Financial Infrastructure**

Financial infrastructure has advanced significantly alongside physical
information and communication technology (ICT) infrastructure and mobile
telephony.

Faster payment systems (FPS) are enabling new business models for
payment services. They enable real-time payment to the payee and are
accessible through a range of innovative payment channels, such as
mobile apps and simplified pro-cesses (for example, using QR codes).
This functionenables licensed payment service providers to innovate the
user experience, spurs competition between card-based payment services
and bank account--based payment services, and enables integration with
customers' social and economic lives.

**Digital ID**\
Digital identification (ID) enables fintech firms and incumbent
financial insti-tutions alike to implement remote, convenient, and
lower-cost customer inter-actions and data exchange without compromising
safety. As noted in the Fintech Market Participants Survey conducted for
this publication, incumbent and fintech firms alike expect a significant
shift of sales, customer onboarding, and customer interactions from
physical to online modes (Feyen et al. 2022b). Achieving this requires
widespread development and adoption of digital ID services.

A well-designed digital ID enables remote identity validation, consent,
and document signing. Thisallows the exchange of data held by other
financial insti-tutions (for example, bank statements); other businesses
(for example, sales or purchase data); and potentially government
agencies (for example, tax data and demographic information). Such
exchanges can enable a financial institution to meet due diligence
requirements not simply to onboard customers but also to assess
creditworthiness and suitability for certain financial services like
invest-ment (for example, by validating net worth).

The increasing role of digital identity and data in financial services
is motivat-ing the development of a new class of financial
infrastructures. Digital ID is becoming an integral part of the value
chain of many fintech models; as such, market infrastructures for
facilitating the provision and validation of digital IDs are emerging.
These take the form of bringing together providers and consumers of
digital ID services and enable customers to assert their identity
digitally across different service providers in a seamless manner.
Examples include FranceConnect, eHerkenning in the Netherlands, and the
National Digital ID (NDID) platform in Thailand.

Similarly, as the scale and range of data being used increases, new
market infrastructures are needed to orchestrate the consent-based
exchange of data. These data exchange platforms are now emerging in many
countries as the implementation of open banking and open finance
frameworks expands. Examples include the Singapore Financial Data
Exchange (SGFinDex) and India's Data Empowerment and Protection
Architecture (DEPA).

>
> **Secured-Assets Infrastructure**\
> Digital invoicing, asset registries, and other infrastructure for

> important drivers of fintech lending. Secured lending instruments can
> reduce credit risk and broaden access to finance beyond those who have

> example, insurance distribution platforms); factoring (for example,
> national reverse factoring platforms in India and Mexico); and
> payments (for example, bill payment platforms and applica-tion
> programming interface \[API\] hubs). These, like a traditional
> financial infra-structure, serve the industry or market as a whole;
> they facilitate the offering of financial products but neither provide

> as neutral with no preference for any particular participant or

> Accordingly, they also pose similar policy and regulatory issues to

> connectivity, and improved processing capacity as well as at
> con-verting regulatory barriers into solvable technology challenges.
> Payments benefit strongly from the revolution in connectivity and have

use, or provide, B2B services. Big Tech firms compound the advantages of
fintech firms, leveraging their large-scale existing customer bases,
customer data, and consumer trust. Technology platforms have
increasingly embedded financial ser-vices into their core offerings.

Small businesses have been important beneficiaries of the digital
transforma-tion of finance. As small merchants participate more in
e-commerce, they develop data trails and may benefit from the embedded
finance provided by online marketplaces. Separately, digitally enabled
efficiencies, tailoring, and risk mitigation have made SME finance a
more viable market, with many fintech firms emerging to serve this
segment.

A few insights from these market developments (discussed further in
appendix A) bear highlighting.

**Redefinition of "banking."** The atomization of services,
recombination of value chains, and financial services provision by
small-focused players and Big Tech firms alike calls into question the
essence of banking or what it could be. Is it deposit taking, or
maintaining an account ledger, or enabling borrowing, or making a credit
decision? In a world where each component of a financial ser-vice may be
provided by a different entity, what matters most, and where should
regulators focus---on the entity with the customer interface, the
balance sheet, the data, the underwriting engine, the payment network,
or the servers that are powering all of it? Should the financial sector
be considered a distinct sector when finance is embedded in so many
other activities? Regulators can mandate that certain activities be
conducted only by specific providers; however, from the customer
perspective, traditional financial providers may become less and less
visible.

**Limitations of data analytics.** Data-driven business models can scale
rap-idly, but data analytics is not a panacea. The positive feedback
loops from cus-tomer activity that generates data being used to provide
additional services that generate more data, combined with network
effects of many digital businesses, can enable rapid growth. These data
can be used for targeted marketing, product tailoring, and credit
screening. However, despite the thousands of unique data elements that
many fintech lenders claim to analyze, most models rely on a small
subset of those elements that tend to correspond to traditional credit
underwrit-ing approaches. Cash flows, consistency of location, and
performance in repay-ing an initial small loan may be gathered from
mobile money transactions and Global Positioning System (GPS) data but
need to map to current account, address, and credit history.

Credit analyses are still better at comparing historical patterns than
predict-ing the future, particularly after a structural break. In an
extreme demonstration of this, the COVID-19 pandemic shifted the
prospective profitability of whole industries and the incomes of
countless businesses and individuals. Lenders who resumed lending
without recalibrating their artificial intelligence (AI) models ran into
trouble quickly.

**Big Tech as both market disruptor and inclusion driver.** Big Tech's
ability to embed a tailored payment, loan, insurance, or other financial
service into any economic, business, or social activity is both a
powerful disruptor of traditional financial services and a potential
driver of financial inclusion. Knowing the transaction context and the
borrower's history, linking a loan to an underlying business activity,
and being able to take repayment directly out of the cash flows

> **Competitive advantages of embedded finance.** Embedded finance has
> intrinsic advantages over third-party lending that enable Big Tech
> firms to com-pete strongly in credit markets. Big Tech platforms have
> customers and their data, control transaction flows, and create enough

> particularly since the bank's risk would be higher as it lacks the
> contextual data, collections, and sanctions capabilities.

> In the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic, lenders closest to the
> underlying economic activity can more easily resume lending and
> contribute to resilience. The pandemic disrupted economies in ways
> that have obviated the value of prior credit history, which have

>
> **New Players: Entry, Concentration, and Competition**
>
> The sheer number of entrants and innovators is indicative of
> competitive pres-sures on traditional providers.By one compilation,
> there were more than 26,000 fintech start-ups globally in 2021 (as of
> November 2021), up from 12,100 in 2018.[3]{.underline} Although
> fintech credit is not yet systemic, fintech lenders are significant in
> cer-tain segments---for example, micro lending in Kenya and retail and
> small business in China and several developed markets. In the year
> before the pandemic, fintech firms' share of US consumer credit (38
> percent) had exceeded the share of tradi-tional banks (28 percent)
> (Rooney 2019). Competitive pressure from new entrants could change the
> behavior of incumbents, which may, for example, take on more risk as
> they seek to compensate for revenue losses. Supervisors should be
> attuned to this dynamic.
>
> **Competition and Concentration**\
> Financial services are thus becoming more competitive but also
> potentially more concentrated. The entry of thousands of fintech
> start-ups as well as new licensing regimes for challenger banks,
> digital banks, alternative lenders, and others speak to that
> competitive pressure.

> International Finance Corporation (IFC) clients on the early impacts
> of COVID-19 found a significant increase in prioritization of
> digitizing channels and internal processes and data ana-lytics (IFC
> 2021).

**46** Fintech and the Future of Finance

localization, particularly in smaller markets. The costs to authorities
to effec-tively supervise a large number of small entities can also be
significant and may be burdensome for EMDEs.

**Emerging Risks and the Roles for Regulation**\
**Promotion of fair competition.** Concerns about market concentration
must be addressed in a balanced way.Some issues, particularly regarding
data abuse by Big Tech firms, are already crystallizing. Concentration
in and of itself, however, is not necessarily a problem. The emergence
of a monopoly may not indicate exclusion-ary practices but rather
powerful network effects that create benefits to consum-ers from
participating on the same platform (for example, on social media or
messaging). A barbell configuration can manifest high concentration
alongside product choice and price competition. Entry regulations that
enable the develop-ment of a reservoir of potential competitors can keep
markets contestable and forestall some types of market abuses by
dominant players.

In some markets, concentration can lead to more intense beneficial
competi-tion, with a positive impact on price and quality. In many
EMDEs, the banking sector is already concentrated; additional
competition, even from a dominant technology player, would increase
consumer choice. Product tying---that is, sell-ing one product or
service as a mandatory addition to purchase of another prod-uct or
conditioned on earlier purchase of another product---as well as
cross-subsidies can benefit consumers in terms of convenience and cost.
In the EMDE context, concentrated mobile money markets have delivered
strong wel-fare benefits. However, market concentrations give
unregulated entities signifi-cant control over access to a marketplace
or to large troves of personal data, and abuses have occurred in some
markets. Furthermore, Big Tech crossovers into finance mean that
monopoly power that might have been beneficial in one mar-ket can now be
wielded, potentially detrimentally, in another. The balance struck
between competition policy enforcement and efficiency and inclusion
goals will vary across countries and across subsectors within countries
at different stages of market development.

**Oversight of entries, exits, and new business models.** Regulators
have struggled to supervise new business models, and the sheer numbers
of new financial services entrants have inevitably led to firm failures
and frauds (Gispert et al. 2022). Exit of some firms is part of a
healthy innovation ecosystem and is not cause for concern if customer
funds have been appropriately segregated and the wind-down is
orderly---which has not always been the case.

Fraud is another matter. P2P lending in China grew very quickly from its
start in 2007 to its peak in 2016, when over 4,000 platforms were active
(Gispert et al. 2022). Numerous instances of fraud and Ponzi schemes (by
some accounts, up to 40 percent of platforms were problematic) resulted
in customer losses. Oversight was tightened, the industry shrank, and
eventually P2P marketplaces were man-dated to convert to regulated small
loan providers. In Europe, two prominent failures---of Wirecard, a
payments processor, and Greensill, a tech-enabled invoice financing
operation---illustrate the challenges to regulators in adequately
supervising complex fintech business models (Gispert et al. 2022). These
fraud-ulent schemes have led to outright losses of capital as well as to
losses of access to funds (for example, when accounts were frozen at
other fintech firms that used Wirecard).

under US\$10, the terms and requirements of which they may not have
fully understood.[6]{.underline} One of the responses of the Kenyan
regulator was to block mobile lenders from recording defaults with the
credit bureau.This approach could be ineffective and hurt digital and
conventional lenders alike seeking to understand the full indebtedness
of a potential borrower without addressing the product appropriateness
issue.

In Indonesia, regulators concerned about aggressive debt collection
practices by Chinese fintech lenders (for instance, using borrowers'
cell phone contacts data) issued rules to restrict online lenders from
using all but a narrow subset of phone data (Potkin, Zhang, and Diela
2018). This movedisrupted the innovative underwriting models that had
been leveraging phone data.

Challenges extend to developed markets as well, as demonstrated in the
United Kingdom by the 583 percent annual percentage rate and aggressive
collection practices of Wonga (a payday loan firm). A carefully
considered approach to strengthening consumer credit codes is needed to
balance innova-tion and access with consumer protection.

**Notes**

1\. This transition will take time, partly because of customer
familiarity with USSD codes and the tariffs as well as sometimes limited
availability of internet access.

> A 2021 survey across five low- to middle-income markets in Africa and
> Asia found that more than 90 percent of transactions still use USSD
> codes despite smartphone penetration rates of 25--40 percent (Pon
> 2021). Patented in 1994, USSD is an interactive, menu-based technology
> that is supported on most mobile devices. USSD messages can be up to
> 182 alphanumeric characters long. USSD is similar to short message
> service (SMS) in that it sends short text-based\
> messages; however, instead of text messages going from user to user,
> USSD messages travel from the user to the mobile network or vice
> versa. USSD creates a real-time connection, which allows for a two-way
> exchange of data between users and the network. This makes the
> technology more responsive than SMS.
>
> Also, like SMS, USSD works on standard phones, feature phones, and\
> smartphones without the need to install any app or program, or access
> to mobile data (GSMA 2018).

2\. In some markets, fintech lenders have been excluded from reporting
to, or querying, credit registries and bureaus. That may be shortsighted
because the expansion of unreported lending will only reduce the value
of registry and bureau data as a picture of the borrower's overall
indebtedness.

3\. "Number of fintech startups worldwide from 2018 to February 2021

4\. International Telecommunication Union (ITU) data show connectivity
of 105 percent, reflecting the fact that in many markets subscribers
have more than one subscriber identity module (SIM) card. See "Mobile
Cellular Subscriptions (per 100 People), 1960--2020," World Bank Data\
dicators Database), .

5\. Routing consumer securities transactions through market makers that
pay for order flow is an example. See, for example, Bair (2021).

6\. The term "nano-loan" does not have a precise definition but
generally indicates a loan for even smaller amounts and tenor than a
microloan.

consumers, particularly those who are less financially literate.
Unauthorized disclosure and use of personal data, including identify
theft, is another key challenge.

**Pass-through compliance.** In a partnership between fintech or Big
Tech firms with incumbent financial institutions, the latter would be
expected to ensure compliance with existing regulations but might not
have the full visibility or ability to enforce it. When these incumbent
institutions are smaller, they might be perceived to be lower risk under
a risk-based supervision framework, and hence risk buildups could go
unnoticed.

**Operational and cybersecurity risks.** The distribution of technology
and access points to end users and the restructuring of value chains
leads to increased complexity, more points of vulnerability, and broader
attack sur-faces for cybercriminals. Cyberattacks or failures
necessitate strong opera-tional resilience frameworks because they
compromise business continuity, carry economic and reputational risks,
and potentially threaten financial stability. Another source of elevated
operational risk is the higher reliance on third-party service
providers, such as for cloud storage and computing, data provision, and
critical business services such as third-party payment process-ing
services.

**Competition.** As described in chapter 3, owing to economies of scale,
net-work effects, reputation, and capital, large providers such as Big
Tech companies could achieve dominant positions quickly, thereby raising
entry barriers and reducing overall competition or contestability.
Market dominance by a limited number of providers could reduce consumer
welfare. However, in markets where competition is limited, the entry of
large providers could have important welfare gains and enhance
competition in the short to medium term. How the market develops from
that point will depend on the confluence of policy actions and market
developments.

**Regulatory arbitrage.**Financial services have been offered by new
entrants that largely operate outside of the regulatory perimeter,
although their activities and risks are similar in nature to those
offered by regulated entities. Similarly, decentralized systems, such as
crypto-assets and peer-to-peer or decentralized finance (DeFi)
platforms, may prove more difficult to regulate and supervise if a
central governing body is absent. Given the supranational nature of some
fintech solutions, cross-border arbitrage opportunities complicate
matters further and call for more international coordination.

**Policy for an Evolving Fintech Market**

How policy goals regarding sound inclusive financial systems and
competitive markets can be achieved depends on the entities providing
financial services, the business models they use, and the market
structure that ensues.The analysis here focuses on likely market
structure outcomes based on underlying technology and economic drivers.
It raises new issues for financial supervision, competition regulation,
and consumer protection as (a) financial services move from the first
phase of *disaggregation* and competition to a new phase of
*reaggre-gation* and concentration alongside competitive entry and
atomization, and (b) embedded finance has begun to demonstrate its
power, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic.

Core Policy Objectives and Evolving Trade-Offs **55**

> **Regulating the Concentrated Market**\
> Salient issues include how to regulate and supervise a growing number
> of new entrants and how to manage increasing concentration at the
> other end of the spec-trum. On the consumer side, growing competition,
> entry of new players from unregulated sectors, and broadened inclusion
> of new customer segments all com-bine to create a dynamic where
> consumers' best interests may be lost in the rush for efficiency,
> market share, and revenues. The raft of new, smaller entrants
> chal-lenges financial supervisors to review the regulatory perimeter
> and to become more adept at monitoring and supervising---and
> leveraging digital tools in regula-tory technology (regtech) and
> supervisory technology (suptech), where appropriate.
>
> The reaggregation and emerging concentration of market power
> introduces challenges in managing both the systemic risks and the
> market-conduct risks of an emerging set of large and potentially
> important global players whose activities cut across banking and
> nonfinancial businesses. For example, concentrated infra-structure
> providers serving the financial sector, such as cloud services and
> digital payments networks, present potential systemic concentrations
> of operational risk. A hardware failure at one payments network left
> millions unable to pay with their cards for about five hours across
> Europe in June 2018 (Bank of England 2019; Togoh and Topping 2018).
> The Financial Stability Board and other standard-setting bodies are
> doing further work in this area to provide guidance on addressing
> concentration risks (see, for example, Crisanto et al. 2019; FSB
> 2019).
>
> **Regulating the Embedded-Finance Market**\
> The proliferation of cross-sector players highlights the challenge of
> interpreting monopoly guidelines in a new era.Concentration may not
> imply monopoly power in a highly contestable market, and the relevant
> market is increasingly difficult to define where traditional financial
> services providers compete with fintech and Big Tech companies in
> specific product areas.
>
> Product tying---part of many platform and embedded-finance value
> propositions---illustrates the growing complexity of balancing
> consumer protection with financial and competition regulation as
> business models and market structures evolve. Although cross-selling
> services has long been a common strategy in the financial sector, it
> has been subject to explicit anti-tying provisions in many markets.
> For example, a credit line was not supposed to be linked to requiring
> the borrower to move its transaction account to the lender.
>
> Unbundling of financial services would tend to reduce anticompetitive
> prod-uct tying. Reaggregation and embedded finance, in contrast, put
> tying at the cen-ter of financial product economics. In multisided
> technology platforms, linking, cross-selling, and cross-subsidizing of
> products has generated both consumer benefits (for example, "free"
> email accounts tied to advertising) and potentially questionable
> practices (for example, search engines charging businesses for
> advertising and favorable search ranking). Now cross-selling is
> extending across financial and nonfinancial services, potentially
> allowing for a firm's dominance in the nonfinancial services to extend
> to the financial sector as well.
>
> These developments will test the boundaries of competition analysis
> and redefine how regulators consider the benefits and costs of
> concentration, product tying, and other aspects of market structure
> and conduct. Platform models that

**56** Fintech and the Future of Finance

combine free services that have network effects with financial services
could become highly concentrated and potentially result in abusive
exercise of monopoly power, as examined in the Market Structure Note
prepared for this report (Feyen et al. 2022). For example, a dominant
social network that has a quasi-monopoly position over small local
businesses' connections to their customers might embed payments in the
social networking experience and make it difficult for a customer to pay
businesses through anything other than the network's payment product.

For borrowers, the increased resilience and access potentially offered
by embedded credit is largely the result of tying credit to other
transactions. A distributor offering supply chain finance inevitably
ties that working capital to the purchase of its products. What may seem
to be low-cost or free tied services from a platform provider are rarely
truly free; in many emerging markets and developing economies (EMDEs)
however, incurring costs in terms of data shar-ing, loss of privacy, or
product lock-ins may be acceptable to gain access to finance that is not
otherwise available.

In some product areas, open data frameworks that eliminate data
monopolies (for example, by conferring data ownership to the data
subjects, who can then make their own data available to different
finance providers) could help ensure that the benefits of innovative
business models can be realized consistent with competitive markets and
consumer protection. These data frameworks require a level of consumer
financial and data literacy. As an alternative, data intermediaries
might enable safe data sharing; they could also help individuals better
understand and enforce their rights over their personal data (World Bank
2021).

**Balancing the Policy Trade-Offs**

More broadly, policy makers will have to address increasingly complex
trade-offs that depend on the level of development of the financial
system and its customers, the preexisting competitive environment, and
other social preferences. The Market Structure technical note prepared
for this publication describes the com-plex policy trade-offs that may
evolve in conjunction with the rapid developments in the financial
sector (Feyen et al. 2022). Fast-paced technological innovation and its
impact on the industry suggest that balancing trade-offs may become more
challenging, especially for EMDEs with capacity constraints and multiple
compet-ing mandates, including the following:

• Financial stability and market integrity

• Efficiency and competition

• Data privacy and consumer protection.

For example, financial inclusion, innovation, and efficiency objectives
may run counter to preserving financial stability. Fintech companies may
promote new lending based on weak business models, or they may be
exposed to increased cyber risks. Big Tech platforms may offer
significant efficiency and inclusion gains, but they can also quickly
dominate markets and become too big to fail. Similarly, reaping the full
innovation and efficiency gains of fintech may require gathering,
processing, and exchanging large amounts of consumer data, which may run
afoul of consumer and data safeguards and could increase financial
integrity risks.

**66** Fintech and the Future of Finance

(World Bank 2021b)*,* these innovations in data generation create new
opportuni-ties for enhancing the economic performance of firms; for
repurposing data to improve the design, execution, and evaluation of
public policies; and for helping individuals and communities make better
choices by accessing more information and knowledge.

**Balancing data protection with open banking.** Because new ways of
col-lecting, organizing, analyzing, and exchanging data are central to
fintech, regula-tors must address the risks while ensuring fair access.
Big Tech firms have largely relied on large troves of user data
generated on their own platforms or acquired from third parties. Fintech
firms, in contrast, have primarily gathered user data through their
apps. Both Big Tech and fintech companies, however, had to gather data
from customers of other financial institutions. As a result, fundamental
data protection and privacy issues have prompted regulatory actions.

Many high-income economiesand a few EMDEs have responded by formu-lating
an overarching legal framework for general data protection and privacy
and issuing open banking regulations. The overarching data protection
and pri-vacy frameworks cover issues related to the collection, access,
and portability of personal information as well as principles related to
data quality and rectifica-tion, lawful processing, purpose
specification, and consent (IMF and World Bank 2019). Open banking
regulations seek to require banks and, in some coun-tries, other
financial institutions as well (for example, in India and Mexico) to
provide a minimum set of data in an online and automated manner to third
par-ties authorized by the account holder (World Bank 2022). These third
parties are brought within the financial sector regulatory perimeter.

Although most of the jurisdictions that have developed an open banking
scheme already had a data protection framework in place, some have
amended such frameworks (as in Australia), and others developed them
after having already implemented an open banking scheme (World Bank
2022). Except in the United States, all high-income economies had a data
protection framework before issuing open banking regulations. In
countries where data protection frameworks do not exist (for example,
the United States), the open banking scheme recognizes the need for a
data-permissioned environment.

In India, following judicial rulings, a data protection framework was
adopted in 2019. This framework includes the construct of "consent
manager" and "data fiduciary" and provides a pathway for development of
open banking (World Bank 2022). Nigeria and Rwanda issued payment
regulations to allow for pay-ment initiation service providers to access
bank data in 2019. Appendix D sum-marizes the open banking framework
adopted in these and other selected countries.

**Balancing artificial intelligence with consumer protection.** As for
data processing, the application of artificial intelligence (AI)
techniques has been shown to pose consumer protection risks and has
prompted regulators and the industry alike to develop guidelines on the
responsible use of AI. In addition, the reliance of AI on past or
unrepresentative data could perpetuate embedded biases that may result
in discrimination and exclusion (see, for example, Vigdor 2019). This
has prompted calls for human oversight and better scrutiny of mod-els
and algorithms to better understand their inner workings and
predictions. Regulators have thus far not intervened directly, although
some have called for the adoption of a codes of conduct, and others have
developed guidelines.[3]{.underline}

by companies related to the platform provider has raised competition
issues. For example, some have questioned the services of group
companies in platform models---for example, the lack of diversity of
money market funds made available to customers of the Alipay third-party
mobile and online payment platform (World Bank 2022).

**Big Tech advantages.** Regulators have sought to adjust the regulatory
frame-work to create space for Big Tech companies to provide financial
services: e-money issuance, digital bank licenses, and open banking.
E-money licenses have been leveraged by telecommunications operators in
EMDEs, notably in Sub-Saharan Africa but also in other regions. Other
Big Tech companies like Google, Facebook, Alipay, Tencent, and Grab and
Gojek have obtained e-money licenses in various jurisdictions. Some
jurisdictions, notably in Asia (such as China, the Republic of Korea,
and Singapore), have also allowed Big Tech com-panies to be shareholders
in digital banks. The other approach has been to lever-age open banking
regulations to allow Big Tech companies to manage the customer interface
for initiating payments, such as through India's Unified Payments
Interface (UPI).

These approaches, while subjecting Big Tech firms to conduct
regulations, do not fundamentally address competition issues, which has
prompted regulators to impose additional requirements. In India, Big
Tech firms were able to lever-age the third-party payment initiation
capability to rapidly expand their pres-ence in the payments market,
prompting the imposition of volume caps.[4]{.underline} In China, the
central bank required central clearing of payment transactions by
e-money providers, in part to make it easier for smaller e-money
providers to compete with Big Tech firms (World Bank 2021a).

Big Tech companies will retain several inherent advantages even if they
are subject to traditional regulatory requirements.Among others, they
can leverage data from their nonfinancial operations,[5]{.underline}
which often have unique insights into customer behaviors and cash flows
to which an incumbent bank would not have visibility. The value of this
information is confirmed by the phenomenon of some Big Tech companies
developing a credit score--like index and selling that infor-mation to
third parties. The advantage over banks may be compounded where open
banking forces incumbent financial institutions to share data with Big
Tech firms, but there is no corresponding requirement on Big Tech firms
to share their customer data.

Another source of advantage may come from product linkages and
cross-subsidies. A Big Tech e-money issuer or digital bank could offer
financial services at a steep discount because it expects to tap other
revenue streams that would grow by offering financial services. For
example, a Big Tech e-money issuer can generate revenue by offering
advertising to a merchant and make the payment services free---a greater
share of payment traffic will, in turn, help improve advertising
offerings. An e-commerce marketplace can offer loans to merchants
selling on its platform and make a margin on the increase in product
sales as well as the loan.

Finally, the increased visibility and leverage over the client's
activities may improve loan performance and collections. When sellers
borrow from an e-commerce platform through which they sell to their
customers, the loan repayments can be collected directly from their
revenues, and they will be reluc-tant to default and risk being cut off
from their customers. The differential in

embedded finance may require not only the expansion of the regulatory
perimeter but also an expanded perimeter of regulators: financial,
consumer protection, competition, data/privacy, and
telecommunications/internet.

**Regulatory Implications**\
The implications of the cross-sectoral nature of fintech for regulation
are pro-found. The boundaries between social networks, digital economy
platforms, and financial services are blurring. Fintech- and Big
Tech-embedded finance cut across financial supervisors, market conduct
and competition authorities, and consumer protection agencies. As a
result, regulatory approaches that separate commerce and banking may
need to be revisited. Analyses of market concentra-tion, use and abuse
of monopoly power, and anticompetitive practices must take into account
the economics of multisided platform models as well as the link-ages of
financial products to other activities where a single provider may have
market power. New dynamics regarding both market structure and

fintech activ-ity. The Regulationtechnical note prepared for this
publication (Gispert et al. 2022) describes a decision framework to
navigate these three critical issues (figure 5.4).

The policy response chosen by each country will depend on the type of
activ-ity and country-specific factors, such as the stage of development
of the financial sector, the size of the market, and the scale and type
of fintech activity.Fintech activities that pose significant risks to
the financial system will likely require authorization and a supervisory
license to operate. The rest might only need to be registered with or
notified to the relevant regulator.

The type of risks posed by the activity and its penetration will be the
most relevant driver but not the only one. Country-specific factors
include the state of the market, capacity constraints, existing
financial regulatory frameworks, and the country's legal tradition. When
the risks perceived are not high, EMDEs tend to allow fintech activity
with no formal regulation. This approachmay be related to the overall
capacity and resource constraints that several of these countries face,
the specific challenges posed by Big Tech firms (which offer a broader
scope of services in EMDEs than in high-income economies),the
often-underdeveloped state of fintech in the country, and lower
competition levels in the financial service markets.

remains a work in progress, and many national authorities still lag in
upgrading their policy frameworks and addressing regulatory
fragmentation.

Some types of crypto-assets, notably global stablecoins, have the
potential to attract broad public use as a means of payments, including
in the decentralized finance (DeFi) ecosystems. In this context, public
authorities are actively explor-ing issuing CBDCs. Widespread adoption
of crypto-assets could challenge the primacy of public money with
implications for, among other things, monetary policy and financial
stability. Some authorities have also noted the concentration and data
protection and privacy risks that large-scale payment service providers
can pose, particularly the ones employing a data monetization-led
business strategy. It is perceived that a CBDC, being a digital version
of fiat currency, could imbue public money with the necessary digital
features and enable it to provide society with a safer, more efficient
alternative while also promoting competition and innovation.

The perceived potential of CBDCs to advance financial inclusion is also
of interest to some public authorities, notably in EMDEs. However, CBDCs
are not a panacea for financial inclusion, because key behavioral,
technological, and infrastructural barriers that are also faced by other
digital payment solutions may remain in place. Further, alternative
avenues to address the gaps that crypto-assets and CBDCs might seek to
address---avenues such as imple-menting fast payment systems, enabling
open banking, extending operating hours of payment systems, expanding
membership of payment systems, and better integrating payment systems
across the world---deserve equal attention.

**Supervisory Implications**\
Countries will need to regularly evaluate the appropriateness of their
supervisory frameworks toaccount for the digital transformation of the
financial sector. Supervisory and regulatory frameworks are closely
linked and influence each other. The supervisory framework should be
well designed to respond to the risks inherent in fintech activities and
flexible enough to adapt to rapid market develop-ments. The framework
should also embed proportionality to ensure that prompt supervisory
actions are commensurate with the level of risk.

A single institutional model to supervise fintech activities is not
necessarily feasible and, to date, no country has created one.Rather,
supervisory responsi-bilities related to fintech tend to follow
preexisting frameworks and mandates for financial sector supervision,
although in some countries there is a debate on whether the existing
framework and approach remains appropriate or whether adaptation and
change is needed.

**New Responsibilities, New Challenges**\
New responsibilities are being allocated to existing authorities.
Because some ser-vices previously provided only by established financial
institutions are now also provided by nonfinancial corporates and
start-ups, questions arise as to which authority must supervise these.
The contours of the regulatory perimeter have implications for
supervision. The implications for supervision of activities outside the
regulatory perimeter on regulated entities will also need to be
assessed. In this regard, various fintech-specific supervisory
challenges stand out.

**78** Fintech and the Future of Finance

Effective supervision of fintech calls for coordination and
information-sharing arrangements between domestic authorities. Fintech
activities may fall within the regulatory perimeter of multiple
agencies, but only a few jurisdictions have a formal body in charge of
coordinating fintech policies. Collaboration mecha-nisms may be
formalized through memorandums of understanding (MoUs) to cover
cross-cutting issues---such as anti-money laundering and combating the
financing of terrorism (AML/CFT) or consumer protection---with other
finan-cial sector regulators, including the national treasury,
prudential authorities, the central bank, the financial sector conduct
authority, telecommunications author-ities, financial intelligence
units, national credit regulators, and stock exchange authorities. The
national or federal government might get involved in these MoUs when the
impact transcends the financial sector, for example, in relation to
digital ID, data privacy, or cybersecurity.

The practice of involving the industry in fintech coordination efforts
in cyber-security, payments, and securities is also becoming more
frequent. Strengthening the engagement with the industry---such as by
including regulatory sandboxes, accelerators, innovation hubs, and
fintech coordination groups---provides excel-lent learning opportunities
for supervisors to develop a deeper understanding of fintech and
identify appropriate regulatory and supervisory responses.

International cooperation on fintech matters will further gain in
impor-tance, both bilaterally and in a multilateral context. In light of
the cross-border and often global nature of fintech developments (for
example, remittances, CBDCs, crypto-assets, cross-border payments, and
cloud-service providers), authorities will need to strengthen
coordination and information sharing to facilitate knowledge transfer
and effectively monitor financial service provi-sion that transcends
jurisdictional boundaries. Initiatives to foster cooperation to agree on
standards to develop suptech solutions that are compatible across
countries are particularly necessary and valuable. The Global Financial
Innovation Network (GFIN), an international network of more than 70
finan-cial regulators launched in 2019, is a new model of international
cooperation on fintech innovation and supervision that aims to increase
collaboration between regulatory agencies in fintech and regtech.

**Winding Down**\
The approach to dealing with fintech failures may need
strengthening.Many juris-dictions have specific crisis management
arrangements for regulated financial institutions, designed to preserve
financial stability; the integrity of the financial sector; and the
savings of depositors, investors, corporates, and households. For the
most part, these regimes are not readily applicable to fintech firms.
However, for fintech firms that work solely as intermediaries of
transactions, the financial risks are limited and no special wind-down
arrangements may be needed. This is the case, for example, for certain
types of robo-advisors, which work like invest-ment advisors. However,
those that also handle client funds and execute the investment advice
have the characteristics of brokers. Similarly, marketplace lend-ing
platforms might need to institute procedures ex ante to support the
orderly termination, transfer, or continued servicing of loans and
investments facilitated by the platform in case the platform exits the
business. Moreover, authorities often impose requirements to ensure
client access to relevant documentation and trans-action data if these
firms fail.

Regulation and Supervision **79**

**80** Fintech and the Future of Finance

Regulators can help to ensure a more seamless payments infrastructure
and support interoperability, for example, by requiring market
participants to develop end-user payment services based on open
data-entry solutions to avoid the creation of closed payment solutions
and fragmentation of the market. Governance of payment systems
increasingly requires governments and regula-tors to be much more
proactive in understanding, and, where needed, to set the standards for
new technologies and business models and operating procedures and rules.

**Central bank service modernization.** The increasing role of fintech
firms, adoption of fast payments, embedded finance, and cross-border
financial flows will put pressure on central banks to modernize their
settlement services.Options range from enhancements to existing systems
to redesigning the provision of central bank money. Maintaining the
status quo of restricting access to central bank settlement assets and
services to only incumbents could amplify risks, hamper competition,
reduce efficiency, and affect the safety and reliability of payment
services.

For central banks, there are two nonexclusive sets of solutions: first,
a more traditional response could be round-the-clock availability of
settlement services, including expanding the range of entities that can
access and embrace open APIs. Second, redesigning the provision of
central bank money for a digital world, tak-ing into account
technological developments, could lead in the direction of CBDCs. The
implications of the former are better understood than the latter.

**Credit information sharing.** The coverage, quality, and ease of
accessing credit information reporting systems can enable new lenders
and also preserve the soundness of incumbents.Whether credit information
is assembled by an industry-led bureau or by a central bank registry,
the core goal of preventing overindebtedness is thwarted if new lenders
do not report credit exposures or lack access on an equal footing to
existing credit exposure information.

At the same time, it should be recognized that inclusion-minded fintech
firms may be lending to segments not currently covered by the bureau or
registry. For example, in markets where there is no differential in
pricing between an inquiry that returns information and a no-hit
inquiry, to mandate that lenders must make bureau inquiries for all
borrowers would impose excess cost on inclusive lenders trying to serve
previously underserved market segments.

Recognizing that fintech business models often leverage alternative
data, such as utility data or transactional data, the scope of credit
information sharing might be expanded beyond lenders. Ideally,
commercially beneficial arrange-ments can induce participation in credit
information sharing, but they may need adjustments to the frameworks for
information sharing to institutionalize the data subjects' control of
their data and protect against unauthorized uses of per-sonal data,
algorithmic discrimination, and other abuses (Salamina et al. 2019).

**Access to government data.** The coverage, quality, and ease of access
to gov-ernment data can be a key enabler for fintech models. Fintech
providers are required to conduct verification of their customers,
conduct ongoing customer due diligence, and validate information on
their customers and their assets. These processes benefit greatly from
access to information held with public authorities, government agencies,
and potentially other private sector players---for example, on ID, land
records, demographic information, income tax records, education records,
and employment history.

**86** Fintech and the Future of Finance

• Ensuring the primacy of core policy objectives, which may call for
custom- ized approaches.

**5. Anticipate market structure tendencies and proactively shape them
to foster competition and contestability in the financial sector.**
While the initial focus has been on facilitating entry, and the momentum
of innovation has been from small start-ups and new entrants, the market
is already rapidly boo-meranging toward concentration of players and
platforms, especially due to economies of scale and network effects in
data. That trajectory may deliver inclusion and efficiency, particularly
in low- and middle-income economies that lack a robust, competitive, and
inclusive banking sector. Regulators will need to proactively monitor
market conduct and ensure that markets remain at least contestable while
continuing to dynamically balance trade-offs between compe-tition,
concentration, efficiency, data protection, and inclusion.

**6. Modernize and open up financial infrastructures to enable
competi-tion and contestability.** Financial infrastructures should be
interoperable and open to both new and traditional players (for example,
through open application programming interfaces \[APIs\]) to promote
network effects, innovation, and competition. The increasing role of
fintech companies, embedded finance by Big Tech companies, digital
money, and cross-border financial flows will put pres-sure on regulators
to ensure that financial infrastructures have fair and transpar-ent
access policies that are not used to lock out competition. This is
particularly critical when the financial infrastructures are owned by
incumbents.

The governance arrangements of financial infrastructures will become an
important element for regulators to monitor and shape. Moreover, with
the entry of new market-level services that take on the characteristics
of financial infrastructures, regulators will need to assess whether and
how to bring them within the regulatory perimeter.

**7. Ensure that public money remains fit for the digital world amid
rapid advances in private money solutions.** Crowding out of public
money will ham-per the ability of public authorities to shape and
safeguard financial sector and economic development. The ongoing
developments in the digitization of the economy and payments, the world
of crypto-assets, and the influence of Big Tech firms in payments and
user data could, over time, challenge the role of pub-lic money,
competition, and privacy.

In addition to strengthening policy frameworks regarding crypto-assets
and Big Tech firms, as well as modernizing and opening up payments and
related market infrastructures, public authorities might need to
consider structural alternatives like central bank digital currencies
(CBDCs). Countries that con-sider launching a CBDC should carefully
evaluate the wide-ranging implications and design options in
consultation with public and private stakeholders.

**8. Pursue strong cross-border coordination and sharing of information
and best practices, given the supranational nature of fintech.** Fintech
devel-opments enable providers to reach a wide set of customers across
borders and provide services without necessarily being subject to
regulation in the custom-ers' jurisdictions. Regulators and public
authorities will need to collaborate and coordinate with their peers to
safeguard their respective financial systems and customers. In this
regard, global standard-setting bodies and international bod-ies like
the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank have a critical role.

**90** Fintech and the Future of Finance

• The consumer experience has been transformed to overcome long-standing
barriers or frictions that had deterred the use of digital payments and
also to meet new demands from payers and payees for increased speed and
conve-nience and lower prices.

• In some cases, like in ride-hailing or meal-ordering apps or in
"one-click" online ordering, the purchase experience has been totally
transformed by making the payment process "invisible" from the
customer's perspective.

• Payments are increasingly becoming a source and provider of data that
are critical for differentiation against competitors and for the
provision of other products and services, including but not limited to
those offered by financial sector entities.

• Innovation in payments has also enabled and shaped up major
developments in the real economy such as the surge of
e-commerce---including transac-tional online services offered by
governments---and in turn new platform models, which have put additional
demands on payment services.

Although innovation in the area of retail payments has been prolific, it
has not fully transmitted to specific payment streams like international
remittances and other forms of cross-border payments, some types of
government payments, and B2B payments.[1]{.underline}For example, the
Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures (CPMI) reports that
cross-border payments lag domestic pay-ments in terms of cost, speed,
access, and transparency (CPMI 2020).

In the area of government payments, many emerging markets and developing
economies (EMDEs) still have a long way to go in digitizing their
payments and collections effectively, largely because of coordination
challenges and other ele-ments that slow down the generalized use of
payment innovations. In this area, however, the COVID-19 crisis has
favored an acceleration of these digitization efforts---for example, to
facilitate the transfer of relief funds while at the same time trying to
ensure social distancing.

As for B2B payments, this market segment has certain unique requirements
like the linkage to invoicing processes and taxation, and payments tend
to be for larger amounts. To date, these unique requirements have not
been fully met.

**Credit**

The available data suggest that digital credit has grown significantly,
driven by Big Tech firms most recently(Cornelli et al. 2020). According
to Bank for International Settlements (BIS) credit statistics, in 2019,
total credit to the nonfinancial sector from banks and other
intermediaries was around US\$185 trillion globally and US\$60 trillion
in EMDEs. Cornelli et al. (2021) document that, in 2018, credit
pro-vided by fintech firms had grown to an estimated US\$296 billion
globally. However, China, one of the leaders in fintech credit growth,
imposed regulatory restrictions, resulting in a global decline in
fintech credit to US\$167 billion in 2019. Fintech lending continued to
grow outside of China in 2018--19, but the overall volume was lower
owing to the decline in China.

In 2020, the biggest portion of the global decline was again in China,
where fintech lending all but ceased with the closure of P2P platforms.
Fintech credit volumes also fell during the COVID-19 pandemic in some
other key

new loan bookings from August 2020 onward and fully recovering
prepandemic monthly disbursement levels by early 2021.

**Remittances**

The Fintech Activity Note shows that technology can help reduce the
costs associ-ated with remittances on which many households in EMDEs
rely (Didier et al. 2022). Remittances are small-value, cross-border,
person-to-person transfers (CPMI and World Bank 2007). They are an
essential source of income for millions of families across EMDEs. When
regulators and policy makers create the right enabling environment,
remittance service providers can leverage new technolo-gies for the
benefit of migrants and their families back home---for example, in the
form of cost and time savings.[3]{.underline} At the same time, the use
of technology can help reduce the time it takes to transfer funds. This
includes time spent for travel and wait times.

Mobile money for international remittance transfers can lower fees for
send-ing remittances.The Global System for Mobile Communications
Association (GSMA) notes that the use of mobile technology reduces the
cost of remittances by half (GSMA 2016, 2018). Based on the Remittance
Prices Worldwide(RPW) database, the World Bank reports that as of the
fourth quarter of 2020, the global average cost for digital remittances
was recorded at 5.11 percent of the total amount sent, while the global
average cost for nondigital remittances was 6.99
percent.[4]{.underline}\
The speed of an international remittance transaction is another
challenge for which innovative models can provide solutions.
International remittances take longer to process from end to end than
domestic transfers for a variety of rea-sons, including differences in
daily cutoff times and closing times in different jurisdictions as well
as the time required for reconciliations, dispute resolutions, and
anti-money laundering and combating the financing of terrorism (AML/
CFT) checks to name a few. New technologies can offer innovative ways to
over-come lengthy procedures for these purposes. The analysis shows that
a larger share of services offered by digital money transfer operators
is associated with lower average costs.[5]{.underline}

**Crypto-Assets and Decentralized Finance**

Technology is gradually blurring one of the last functional
boundaries---the dis-tinction between an individual and a financial
intermediary. In a future of increased connectivity and decentralized
finance (DeFi), individuals may play hybrid roles or even directly
provide financial services. For example, if search and contracting costs
are sufficiently reduced, an individual with savings to deploy need not
place the deposit at a bank but instead can lend money directly to one
or more borrowers.

Distributed ledger technology (DLT) has already demonstrated the
potential to transfer value without intermediaries. P2P marketplaces
have demonstrated the feasibility, and the risks, of direct lending.
Various platforms are developing blockchain-native assets that will
enable investments without brokers or exchanges. The pieces are falling
into place to enable intermediary-free finance to develop as another
stream of financial services.

cheaper remittances, spur competition in payment services and thus lower
costs, and support greater financial inclusion" (Coeuré 2019).

**Central Bank Digital Currencies**\
These developments have prompted central banks and public authorities to
evaluate the issuance of digital variants of fiat currency---central
bank digital currencies (CBDCs)**---**because a large-scale shift to
crypto-assets or stablecoins would have implications for, among other
things, financial stability and monetary sovereignty. CBDCs, unlike
crypto-assets and stablecoins, would be a liability of the central bank
and be a digital variant of fiat currency---and as such, being legal
tender, would be freely convertible to notes and coins and commercial
bank money at par.

Central banks and international bodies are actively deliberating on
different design options for CBDCs, and the discussions thus far
categorize CBDCs in sev-eral ways (World Bank 2021):

• By who has access (wholesale versus retail)

• By whether there is an underlying account (account-based versus token
ver- sus DLT account)

• In the case of retail CBDCs, by who manages the customer relationship
(Tier 1, as when the central bank manages the relationship, versus Tier
2, when licensed financial institutions manage the customer
relationships)

• By scope of use (domestic versus cross-border).

To date, The Bahamas, the Eastern Caribbean Central Bank, and Nigeria
have launched retail CBDCs that are account-based, using a two-tiered
design and restricted to domestic use. China is conducting live testing
on a retail CBDC and has made the same design choices. Several other
countries, includ-ing Ghana and Jamaica, are in advanced stages of
issuing retail CBDCs. Although CBDCs need not be built on decentralized
architectures, they could nevertheless have a role in supporting the
functioning of the DeFi services and provide an alternative to
stablecoins and crypto-assets.

Cross-border payments service providers have emerged that use
open-source technologies built on top of Bitcoin (that is, the Lightning
Network).These pro-viders aim to enable near-instant,
mobile-to-mobile-based, small-value transac-tions, perhaps at lower cost
than existing solutions, using promising new technologies. However,
these technologies remain largely untested in a real-world environment
at scale. Moreover, these services may raise various issues including
liquidity, operational issues, consumer protection, and money
laun-dering and terrorist financing risks.

**Transformation of Incumbents and B2B Services**

Incumbent financial institutions have also adopted new technologies and
reconfigured their production of financial services to improve
efficiency and compete with new entrants.The Fintech Market Participants
Survey conducted for this publicationfound that digital transformation
is a strategic priority for the overwhelming majority of incumbents, to
shed overhead costs

> 2022).

> origination to shift from predominantly 0--25 percent in 2019 (figure

> Nevertheless, banks expected to continue serving customers through

>

merchant of record, working with a merchant acquirer to accept card
payments, and most users in its core markets have credit or debit cards.
Executing payments for Amazon sellers became another part of the overall
marketplace offering. Providing Amazon Pay to other websites and online
sellers[10]{.underline} is a reflection of Amazon's market
dominance---as if to say, "Your customer is probably already an Amazon
user, so we have his or her payments information"---as well as consumer
preferences for convenience and privacy.

Platforms and Big Tech firms are increasingly offering credit to their
users, directly or via partners.A common use case is providing working
capital for merchants selling through e-commerce platforms. Because the
platform has extensive information about the merchant's prior sales,
fulfillment record, customer satisfaction, and other data, it is in a
position to predict cash flows and ability to repay. And because it also
is handling the merchant's revenues, it can take repayment for a loan
out of future sales through the platform. In some cases, this embedded
lending is done by the platform itself and in other cases through
partnerships with fintech lenders or banks. Another instance of embedded
finance is buy-now-pay-later funding for consumers, which leverages the
selling website's customer acquisition and data.

**SME Finance**

One important market segment that is benefiting from the digital
transformation of finance (and of commerce more broadly) is the small
and medium enterprise (SME) sector. Fintech can help address key
barriers SMEs face in access to finance, particularly in EMDEs: high
cost to serve; lack of credit history or collateral; and bankability,
both in terms of registration, verification, and record keeping and in
terms of financial literacy and capacity (Teima et al. 2022). As an
example of the potential regarding cost to serve, 90 percent of banks
responding to the Fintech Market Participants Survey expect digital
transformation to reduce costs of SME lending (Feyen et al. 2022b).

New entrants (fintech and Big Tech firms) are driving tailored
customer-centric products and processes as well as new business models
that can compete with traditional players on price, convenience, and
inclusivity. Banks and NBFIs are adopting new technology to compete,
sometimes in partnership with fintech firms. A bank that successfully
deploys technology to serve its customers better and more profitably
will have lower unit costs and lower cost of capital as well as more
data to fine-tune its algorithms, further reducing its credit costs.
From the perspective of SMEs, new entrants offering tailored, focused
products and large players improving their efficiency and pricing by
leveraging technology all help improve access to finance.

To realize this potential, economies need adequate digital
infrastructure, reg-ulatory frameworks supportive of digital onboarding,
new providers, and both innovative products and capacity building for
SMEs. Promoting broad-based digitization of SME activities would not
only improve entrepreneurs' efficiency and access to markets but also
reinforce improvements in SME registration and identity verification and
create a foundation of business data that can used for financing.

> **Methodology**\
> This note tackles this measurement challenge by leveraging a wide

> covers three dimensions of fintech activity: (a) fintech firm creation

> (b) use of fintech credit and digital payments, now the most commonly
> used digital financial services, especially in low- and middle-income
> countries; and (c) use of mobile distribution channels for financial
> services.[1]{.underline} The fintech activity index is positively
> correlated with countries' overall level of economic development. For
> instance, high-income countries generally rank higher than middle- and

> fintech index but also along its three constituent dimensions.
> However, signifi-cant variation across both regions and income groups
> persists, suggesting that other enabling factors matter.
>
> This note then uses the index to systematically analyze the
> association between fintech activity and a wide range of economic and
> technological factors in a multivariate regression
> setting.Specifically, the paper explores the role of three broad sets
> of enabling factors:
>
> • *Basic foundations,* including information and communication
> technology (ICT) and financial infrastructures
>
> • *Financial sector development,* distinguishing between the
> development of the banking system and capital markets
>
> • *The enabling policy environment,* capturing the legal and
> regulatory frame- works for digital financial services.
>
> **Key Findings**\
> **Basic foundations.** First, the estimations show that fintech
> activity is positively associated with ICT and financial
> infrastructures, though the relevance of the latter varies across
> types of fintech services. Specifically, the evidence indicates that
> the ICT payments infrastructure plays a more important role in the use
> of digital payment services, whereas the development of credit
> information sys-tems, a financial infrastructure, is more relevant for
> the use of digital lending services.
>
> **Financial sector development.** Second, the analyses also show a
> robust neg-ative association between fintech activity and bank
> development, consistent with the view that digital financial services
> may have more opportunities to develop in countries where the
> underserved and unserved shares of the market are relatively large.
> Countries with more stringent overall banking regulations exhibit
> subdued fintech activity, suggesting that this is linked to a less
> permissive environment for innovation and fintech entrants. At the
> same time, bank app downloads are more prevalent in countries with
> more stringent banking regula-tions, suggesting in these cases that
> the digital transformation is driven by incumbents.
>
> Importantly, the estimations also show that fintech activity is
> positively cor-related with capital market development. These
> correlations stem from the development of digital financial services
> by institutions other than banks, such as fintech companies. The
> positive association with capital market development suggests that a
> supportive funding environment for fintech firms, especially start-up
> equity financing, can play an important role. For example, the mobile
> app data show that downloads of nonbanking apps are significantly
> positively related to the development of capital markets but
> negatively associated with banking system development. The opposite
> patterns are observed for bank app downloads. The analysis thus
> supports the idea that the distinction between incumbent banks and
> fintech companies is particularly important when explor-ing the
> potential drivers of fintech activity.

activity to flourish. The degree of fintech activity is consistently on
the low end of the distribution in countries scoring poorly on policy
indexes that capture the existence of legal and regulatory frameworks
relevant for digital financial ser-vices, but it varies widely across
countries scoring high on these indexes. In fact, several countries
exhibit relatively low levels of fintech activity despite having a
supportive enabling policy environment. Finally, regulation could have a
positive and stabilizing impact on fintech activity in the longer term.
These benefits are not likely to be reflected in the analysis, given the
relatively short time horizon.

Regarding the role of sector-specific legislation and regulations, the
results show mixed patterns. Although the existence of laws and
regulations for e-money, digital identification, e-signatures, and
electronic Know Your Customer (eKYC) frameworks tends to be positively
associated with fintech activity, the coefficient on consumer protection
tends to be negative. The results, however, are not as forceful as those
related to the other set of enabling factors and may reflect the
complexities of policy interactions, preconditions, and trade-offs at
different levels of fintech development as well as measurement
challenges. Moreover, it is important to recognize that alternative
policy combinations can promote innovation and foster fintech activity,
with similar outcomes.

Overall, the demands on the enabling environment will likely evolve as
fin-tech activity develops. Finding the right balance between trade-offs
at every stage of fintech development remains essential to promote
activity and innova-tion while keeping excessive risks in check.

**Additional analyses.** Finally, separate in-depth analyses documented
in the appendixes of the Fintech Activity Note explore two additional
topics: the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on finance app downloads and
the link between the digitization of remittances services and remittance
costs. On the for-mer, the paper's analysis of mobile app download
trends indicates that the pan-demic may have accelerated fintech
adoption. Moreover, the evidence indicates that the strict social
distancing practices, including government-implemented containment
measures such as lockdowns, quarantines, and travel restrictions
required to mitigate the spread of the coronavirus, have amplified the
use of digital financial services.

As for the link between the digitization of remittances services and
remit-tance costs, the results indicate that digital service providers
may help lower the costs of cross-border remittances, a key financial
service for households in many emerging markets and developing
economies. Specifically, the analysis shows that remittances costs are
lower in corridors with a higher prevalence of digital service
providers.

Digital technologies have made an indelible impact on the provision of
financial services by new entrants and incumbents alike. The World Bank
conducted a global survey on fintech and digital transformation of a
range of financial market participants.The survey sought to capture
market perceptions of the impact of fintech and digital technology on
the following:

**108** Fintech and the Future of Finance

that Big Tech firms are rapidly expanding their footprint in finance and
can use Big Data in ways that reduce the need for collateral. Meanwhile,
incumbent financial institutions have adapted by adopting new
technologies and by disag-gregating their production of financial
services to improve efficiency.

Digital innovation could drive a range of industrial organization
outcomes. On the one hand, digital technology enables niche providers to
reach a target customer base and be economically viable. On the other,
customer acquisition, funding, "assembly," and switching costs tend to
favor larger providers. One pos-sibility is a "barbell"-shaped market,
composed of a few large players and many niche players. The large,
multiproduct players could include traditional financial institutions,
fintech firms, and Big Tech firms---both incumbents and new entrants.
Small players may include product-, geographic-, or sector-focused
fin-tech firms and incumbents.

Although a barbell market is not the only potential outcome, it is a
central case given the economic forces at work. It is a potential
steady-state market structure as some participants leverage scale
economies and network effects to grow larger while innovation continues
to result in new entrants. Market forces will push players to either
hyperfocus or aim for the large, multiproduct type of service offering.
However, atomization---the reduction of services to their most basic
parts---may continue and reaggregation could stall, leading to a market
of more small players. Then again, limits on entry could result in a
completely dif-ferent market configuration. It's difficult to predict.

**Policy Implications**\
This analysis gives rise to important policy issues regarding
competition, regula-tory perimeters, and how to ensure a level playing
field. Concentration risks may increase in the provision of financial
services to end users, and in the provision of infrastructure to
financial institutions. Market structures that concentrate data and
supercharge network effects could reduce intermediation costs and
broaden inclusion. In many markets, however, the resulting market power
might be detri-mental. Competition regulators will have to strike a
balance appropriate to the needs of their markets, since different
societies will attach different preferences to market structure
outcomes.

At the same time, financial regulatory authorities are working to manage
pol-icy trade-offs between stability and integrity, competition and
efficiency, and consumer protection and privacy. The barbell outcome,
for example, could pres-ent challenges to stability regarding both large
and small payers. Widespread access to data raises privacy concerns.
Regulators need to balance the innovation and efficiency brought by new
entrants with the potential challenges for over-sight, enforcement, and
consumer protection. Emerging policy approaches---such as new antitrust
rules for the digital era, data mobility requirements, and data
protection laws---may help mitigate the policy trade-offs. Yet the
responsi-bility for these changes generally lies with different public
authorities as well as with legislatures.

Financial services are undergoing a profound transformation. To navigate
this new territory effectively, and to balance the necessary policy
goals, authorities will need to collaborate. This must occur both
domestically---with cooperation between central banks, financial sector
regulators, other industry regulators, and competition and data
protection authorities---and across borders.

and innovation goals. In others, a combined approach, taking into
account the activ-ity and the entity, might be necessary to ensure
financial stability. In any case, there needs to be clear definition of
which activities are under the regulatory perimeter and which
requirements apply, including the need for licenses. Some fintech
activi-ties will require licenses with integrity (anti--money laundering
and combating the financing of terrorism \[AML/CFT\]) and conduct
requirements. The introduction of data protection provisions in
licensing frameworks is common. Activities that could potentially pose
risks to stability should face prudential requirements.

Competition and inclusion objectives will become more relevant from a
financial policy view, given the growing interdependencies and
trade-offs with core priority mandates of preserving stability,
integrity, and safety of the finan-cial sector.The multiplicity of new
entrants and the potential for dominant play-ers (for example,
incumbents, Big Techs, platforms) and first movers (for example, M-Pesa)
to create barriers and generate distortions has led to an increased
recognition of the strong links between inclusion, competition, and
financial stability. Indeed, targeted participation by financial service
authorities in competition policy matters is increasingly being observed
in EMDEs. The importance of the potential role of prudential and conduct
regulation in mitigat-ing barriers to market access and reining in
abusive dominant practices should not be understated.

Cooperation, both interagency and cross-border, can help in the design
and implementation of a sound supervisory response to fintech, which can
be par-ticularly challenging for EMDE countries suffering from
supervisory capacity constraints or juggling competing policy
priorities. An effective supervisory function for fintech activities is
as essential as an appropriate regulatory regime. Supervisory processes
and methods may need significant changes. Supervisors' knowledge,
skills, and tools should keep pace with the speed of innovation and
related risks, including cyber threats.Building proper exper-tise is
crucial, and supervisory technology (suptech) and regulatory technol-ogy
(regtech) solutions could be excellent catalysts for this.

Fintech is cross-sectoral and cross-country, making cooperation among
agencies at the national and international levels essential for sound
supervi-sion. Although many supervisors in Group of Twenty (G-20) EMDEs
partici-pate in international forums, smaller jurisdictions may need to
rely on international financial institutions and other available
channels---for example, the Global Financial Innovation Network
(GFIN)---to raise issues, keep abreast of global developments, and
exchange best practices. Involving the industry in fintech policy
coordination efforts in a responsible and transparent way also appears
increasingly relevant in areas such as cybersecurity, data, payments,
and securities as well as for the design and implementation of regtech
and suptech solutions (Appaya et al. 2020).

Further, authorities must ensure that client funds are well preserved
and that proper wind-down mechanisms are in place for systemically
relevant firms operating in fintech. For crisis management, fintech
providers should be treated the same as their peers in traditional
finance. For e-money institutions (EMIs) and payment institutions,
regardless of their size, mechanisms should be estab-lished to require
adequate ring-fencing of client funds and proper segregation, preferably
by keeping them in government securities or deposited with the central
banks.

**112** Fintech and the Future of Finance

from greater consumer accessibility to sometimes unfamiliar or more
complex financial products.[6]{.underline} For example, a rapid
expansion of the peer-to-peer lending (P2PL) market in China in the
first half of the 2010s was followed by significant platform collapses,
incidents of fraud, and platform operator misconduct, which caused
significant losses to consumers.[7]{.underline} Although digital
microcredit has expanded access to credit in some developing economies,
countries such as Kenya and Tanzania have seen large numbers of
borrowers unable to repay loans owing to irresponsible lending
practices.[8]{.underline}\
Similarly, despite significant uptake of electronic money (e-money) in
many developing markets, this has been accompanied by a rise in a
variety of risks for consumers, including potential loss of funds due to
fraud and unscrupulous fee charging. Such negative experiences, in
addition to harming consumers directly, may also lead to greater
mistrust of fintech and the financial sector overall.

The COVID-19 pandemic has further accelerated the widespread transition
of consumers to digital financial services and fintech, highlighting
their signifi-cant benefits while also demonstrating how risks to
consumers can increase in times of crisis and economic stress.For
example, reports from Indonesia indi-cate that individual lenders or
investors have been adversely affected by risky loans made through P2PL
platforms, as have been borrowers who obtained such loans and are now
struggling to get lenders or investors to restructure
them.[9]{.underline} Significant numbers of low-income consumers have
faced difficulty repaying existing debts because of the
pandemic.[10]{.underline} Small enterprises have been severely affected
by widespread closures and safety measures to slow the spread of
COVID-19, thus decreasing enterprises' profitability and impeding
repayment obligations.[11]{.underline} This in turn exposes their
investors to increased risk of loss from their investments. In addition,
significant increases in fraudulent app-based digital microcredit
lenders have been observed during COVID-19 lockdowns (Fu and Mishra
2020).

Authorities responsible for financial consumer protection (FCP)
regulations are increasingly faced with the challenge of developing or
adapting regulations to address fintech-generated risks to consumers.
The task of regulators in developing countries is even more difficult if
they tackle this new challenge while having to implement a baseline FCP
regulatory framework.[12]{.underline} In a recent survey, regulators
identified their limited internal technical expertise as the foremost
impediment to regulating and supervising "alternative finance" (such as
P2PL and equity crowdfunding) effectively (World Bank and CCAF 2019,
63).

**Objectives of the Note**\
This note provides (a) an overview of new manifestations of consumer
risks that are significant and cross-cutting across four key fintech
products: digital microcredit, P2PL, investment-based crowdfunding, and
e-money;[13]{.underline} and (b) examples of emerging regulatory
approaches to target such risks. It is based on a more detailed recent
World Bank Policy Research Paper, "Consumer Risks in Fintech: New
Manifestations of Consumer Risks and Emerging Regulatory Approaches"
(World Bank 2021). The research paper delves more deeply into each of
the four key fintech products and their associated risks. Its appendix
provides an overview of product-specific risks, which the research paper
discusses in greater detail.

> digital microcredit providers focus on loan quantity over quality to
> maximize

**114** Fintech and the Future of Finance

fee-related returns. Such risks can be exacerbated in markets where
fintech enti-ties are attempting to grow their revenues and size
quickly.

Potentially harmful conflicts can also arise where fintech entities are
empow-ered to make decisions affecting the risk of loss on loans but
where consumers bear that risk---such as when a P2PL or crowdfunding
platform operator assists with loan or investment selections without
performing adequate due diligence.

Corresponding regulatory approaches include placing positive obligations
on fintech entities to

• Manage and mitigate conflicts of interest;

• Act in accordance with the best interests of their consumers;

• Undertake adequate assessments regardless of business model; and

• Prohibit business arrangements that encourage conflicted behavior.

**Platform unreliability or vulnerability to cyber threats.** Consumers
may face a heightened risk of adverse impacts from platform or
technology unreliability or vulnerability. They may be more vulnerable
to cyber fraud when acquiring fintech products than when accessing
financial products through more traditional channels, because
interaction with fintech providers is largely or exclusively via digital
and remote means. Platform or other tech-nology malfunctions can
negatively affect consumers in ways ranging from inconvenience and poor
service to monetary loss and loss of data integrity---the risk of which
may increase because of heavier reliance on automated transaction
processing.

Regulatory approaches to addressing such risks include specific
obligations on fintech entities to address technology and
systems-related risks and risks associated with outsourcing.

**Fintech business failures.** Some fintech entities may be at greater
risk of business failure or insolvency than established financial
service providers because of inexperience, untested businesses, and
market factors affecting long-term viability. This can mean that
consumers whose funds are held or adminis-tered by a fintech entity face
correspondingly greater risk of loss if the provider becomes insolvent
or the business ceases to operate. Consumers may risk losing their
committed loan principals and investment funds or repayments as well as
earned investment returns being held or administered by a P2PL or
crowdfund-ing platform that fails. Insolvency of e-money issuers or
banks holding e-money floats similarly puts client funds at risk,
especially where there is no deposit insurance.

Regulatory approaches to address such risks include requirements for
fintech entities to segregate their clients' funds from other funds and
to have in place business-continuity and resolution arrangements.

**Disclosure and transparency issues.** The digital environment poses
inher-ent challenges for disclosure and transparency, amplified by the
novelty of fin-tech product offerings and consumers' lack of experience
with such products. Information provided via digital channels may not be
appropriately formatted for consumer understanding or retention. Poor
design of user interfaces may hamper consumer comprehension or exploit
behavioral biases by concealing or underplaying "negative" aspects such
as risks and costs. Fintech can also give

**Additional Considerations**\
It is not the intent of this note to suggest that all risk mitigants it
discusses should be implemented. For any regulator contemplating
implementing the kinds of reg-ulatory measures discussed in this note,
it will be important to prioritize and take a risk-based approach, to
tailor regulatory approaches to country context, and to balance the need
for consumer protection with the resulting impact on industry and market
development and innovation. Moreover, it would not necessarily be
advisable for a country to implement all of the regulatory measures
discussed in this note immediately or to transplant approaches from
other jurisdictions with-out adjustment. This note also summarizes a
range of key implementation matters for regulators to consider.

**Innovation in Payments: Opportunities and Challenges for EMDEs
(Payments Note) by Dorothee Delort and Jose Antonio Garcia Luna**\
The global economy is undergoing a rapid digital transformation that is
chang-ing many conventional notions about our behavior and preferences.
This includes the way in which we---as consumers, as businesses, or in
interactions with government---seek out goods and services and pay for
them or how we receive money from others or transfer it to family or
friends. As the payments industry undergoes radical changes from digital
transformation, users, providers of pay-ment services, and regulators
are adapting to the new dynamics at varying paces.

This note discusses the most significant innovations in payments and
their key impacts and implications on users, banks and other payment
service pro-viders, regulators, and the overall structure of the
payments market. The note places special emphasis on how emerging
markets and developing economies (EMDEs) can reap the benefits of
payment innovations in terms of costs, con-venience, accessibility, and
inclusion for individuals and firms while leapfrog-ging development of
their payments markets and effectively supporting economic activity.

Payments are probably the financial activity most affected by
innovation, undergoing radical changes from various perspectives. This
transformation has been prompted by the adoption of new technologies and
business models, by the emergence of new market players, and by changes
in the structure of the market. This is having a profound impact beyond
the realm of payments and is also affecting the real economy. The
following changes are significant:

• *Payments have become a stand-alone product,* no longer just a
supporting function typically offered only by banks as part of a bundle
of services and with comfortable profit margins. In other words,
payments have become a separate, identifiable service offered by a
growing number of providers, including nonbanks, exercising downward
pressure on fees and margins and fueling upward demand for quality.

• *The consumer experience has been transformed* as long-standing
barriers or deterrents to the use of digital payments are gradually
being overcome, help-ing meet new demands from payers and payees for
increased speed and con-venience and lower prices.

>
> As for B2B payments, this market segment has certain unique

• Robust, secure, and universally accepted company ID and registration
frame- works for SMEs; and

• Adequate data protection and data privacy regulations.

In addition, policy and regulatory recommendations that are specific to
digi-tal financial products for SME financing can be classified around
the following themes:

• Promote the digitization of SMEs' operations, improve the availability
of SME information, expand credit information sharing, and support
efficient and widely accessible digital payment systems

• Develop modern credit infrastructure frameworks to support the
introduc- tion of fintech asset-based lending products for SMEs

• Support the growth and development of debt and equity capital
platforms to improve SME access to finance through the establishment of
regulatory frameworks that balance innovation with investor and consumer
protection.

**What Does Digital Money Mean for Emerging Market and**\
**Developing Economies? (Digital Money Note) by Erik Feyen, Jon Frost,
Harish Natarajan, and Tara Rice**\
Physical cash and commercial bank money are dominant vehicles for retail
payments around the world, including in emerging markets and developing
economies (EMDEs).Yet payments in EMDEs are marked by several key
deficiencies---such as lack of universal access to transaction accounts,
widespread informality, limited competition, and high costs,
particularly for cross-border payments. Digital money seeks to address
these deficiencies.

This note categorizes new digital money proposals. These include
crypto-assets, stablecoins, and central bank digital currencies (CBDCs).
It assesses the supply and demand factors that may determine which
countries are more likely to adopt these innovations. It also lays out
particular policy challenges for authorities in EMDEs. Finally, it
compares these digital money proposals with digital innovations such as
mobile money, retail fast-payment systems, new products by incumbent
financial institutions, and new entrants such as specialized
cross-border money transfer operators.

Proposals for global stablecoins have put a much-needed spotlight on
deficiencies in financial inclusion and in cross-border payments and
remittances in EMDEs. Yet stablecoin initiatives are no panacea.
Although they may achieve adoption in certain EMDEs, they may also pose
particular development, macroeconomic, and cross-border challenges for
these countries and have not been tested at scale. Several EMDE
authorities are weighing the potential costs and benefits of CBDCs. The
authors argue that the distinction between token-based and account-based
money matters less than the distinction between central bank and
non-central bank money. Fast-moving fintech innovations that are built
on or improve existing financial plumbing may address many of the issues
in EMDEs that both private stablecoins and CBDCs aim to tackle.

> **Acceleration of Fintech Use during the COVID-19 Pandemic**
>
> Globally, the pandemic has intensified fintech use. Social distancing
> and other containment measures adopted on a global scale to mitigate
> the spread of COVID-19 have increased the benefits of digital
> financial services (DFS). Traditional financial services are
> predominantly built on cash transactions and face-to-face interactions
> with financial service providers---interactions that were eliminated
> in favor of social distancing. DFS, on the other hand, could proceed
> because they are largely predicated on remote, contactless, and
> cashless payments and transactions.
>
> In several emerging markets and developing economies, mobile money
> activ-ity declined as the pandemic struck, alongside the overall
> decline in economic activity. As lockdowns were lifted, mobile money
> transactions recovered and grew to levels well above the prepandemic
> baseline, even allowing for trend growth. Registered accounts grew by
> 13 percent with active accounts growing by 17 percent, indicating that
> many users who had registered but not used their accounts were now
> active (GSMA 2021). Transaction volume rose by 15 percent and the
> value of transactions by 22 percent. One study found that, in the
> United States, fintech use during the pandemic rose from 36 percent to
> 42 percent among consumers surveyed (Krivkovich et al. 2020).
>
> The pandemic also accelerated providers' plans for digital
> transformation. More than 80 percent of all Fintech Market
> Participants Survey respondents felt that COVID-19 had increased the
> need for fintech and digital transformation (Feyen et al. 2022).
> Digitization in customer channels, product adaptation, and internal
> processes were strategic priorities.

> Consumer behavior also changed because of the pandemic. The Fintech
> Activity Note looked at novel app download data (Didier et al. 2022).
> This data set, reflecting the stream of new users of financial apps,
> provided insights into DFS adoption worldwide during the COVID-19
> pandemic.
>
> The analysis in the Fintech Activity Note showed a marked spike in
> world-wide financial app downloads, especially of nonbank financial
> apps, during the first peak months of the pandemic. The increase is
> particularly marked for non-bank financial apps. Global downloads of
> nonbank financial apps increased by 45 percent, from an average of
> about 7 million downloads per day during the last quarter of 2019 to a
> peak of over 10 million on April 15, 2020---around the same time as
> the peak of policy measures taken to constrain community mobility
> (Didier et al. 2022).
>
> The analysis also shows a robust positive correlation at the country
> level between the growth in downloads of the top 100 financial apps
> since the out-break of the pandemic and the severity of the impact of
> COVID-19, even after controlling for gross domestic product per capita
> and demographic characteris-tics (figure C.1). Moreover, the
> estimations indicate that the increase in financial app downloads was
> related to the stringency of community mobility policies or practices
> rather than the contagion of the disease itself in a given country.

> **Principles for Ethical Use of Artificial Intelligence and Data
> Analytics**
>
> Various bodies are developing principles to ensure the ethical use of
> artificial intelligence (AI) and data analytics. Two such examples are
> described below.
>
> **European Commission**
>
> The European Commission (EC) issued guidelines on the ethical use of
> AI in 2019 (since updated in 2021) as government authorities and
> private companies explore the opportunities and risks of this new
> technology. The guidelines list seven key principles for ethical
> development of AI, including ensuring human agency and oversight,
> privacy and data governance, nondiscriminatory and non-biased
> algorithms, accountability in the systems, and robustness and
> traceability of AI systems (AI HLEG 2019).
>
> The principles state that besides ensuring full respect for privacy
> and data protection, adequate data governance mechanisms must also be
> ensured, con-sidering the quality and integrity of the data and
> ensuring legitimized access to data. It must be ensured that data
> collected about individuals will not be used to unlawfully or unfairly
> discriminate against them. The principles also require that AI systems

> people be informed of the data being used to make decisions and how
> the data affect them, taking into account verified relevant
> supplementary data provided by data subjects (MAS 2018).

> CBDC is not a well-defined term and is used to refer to a number of
> concepts. However, it is envisioned by most to be a new form of
> central bank money---that is, a central bank liability, denominated in
> an existing unit of account, that can serve both as a medium of
> exchange and a store of value. A CBDC is a digital form of central
> bank money that is different from balances in traditional reserve or
> settlement accounts (CPMI 2018).
>
> A newly licensed bank competing with established financial
> institutions. "Challenger banks" emerged as a phrase in the UK market
> to denote greenfield banks built from scratch and unrelated to the
> dominant financial service providers in the market. The entry of
> challenger banks was encouraged to increase competition following the
> 2008--09 Global Financial Crisis. Metro Bank (the first new bank
> license issued in the UK in 100 years), Virgin Money, and others
> focused on improving the retail branch experience. Some challenger
> banks such as Starling, Oak North, and others rely more exclusively on
> digital channels.
>
> An innovation in computing that allows for the use of an online
> network ("cloud") of hosting processors to increase the scale and
> flexibility of computing capacity (FSB 2019)
>
> The provision of a financial service in the context, or integrated
> into the workflow, of another activity (for example, integration of
> payments into the ride activity on a ride-hailing platform, or taking
> out a loan on an e-commerce platform)\
> See also **[embedded financ]{.underline}e**.

> Systems used by commercial banks and other financial institutions to
> manage the operations of their "core" products like current and saving
> accounts and loans

> • Digital assets represented in a manner that enables peer-to-peer
> exchange without need for an interme-diary institution maintaining
> record of ownership (see also **[digital assets]{.underline}**).
>
> • Digital representation of traditional assets---for exam-ple,
> financial instruments, a basket of collateral, or real assets---using
> technologies that can enable a peer-to-peer transfer (adapted from FSB
> 2019). The eco-nomic value and rights derived from these assets is
> embedded into the tokens.
>
> • In the payment cards domain, to indicate provision-ing of an
> alternate account identifier in a variety of devices that links back
> to the primary account identifier.

> • Exchange between virtual assets and fiat currencies

• Exchange between one or more forms of virtual assets

> • Transfer of virtual assets

> • Safekeeping and/or administration of virtual assets or instruments
> enabling control over virtual assets
>
> • Participation in and provision of financial services related to an
> issuer's offer and/or sale of a virtual asset.

> Fintech---the application of digital technology to financial

> other financial products and services---and the COVID-19 pandemic has
> accelerated this process. Digitalization of financial services and
> money is helping to bridge gaps in access to financial services for
> households and firms and is promoting economic development. Improved
> access to basic financial services translates into better firm
> productivity and growth for micro and small businesses, as well as
> higher incomes and resilience to improve the lives of the poor.
> Technology can lower\
> transaction costs by overcoming geographical access barriers;
> increasing the speed, security, and transparency of transactions; and
> allowing for more tailored financial services that better serve
> consumers, including the poor. Women can especially benefit.
>
> Yet too many people and firms still lack access to essential financial
> services that could help them thrive. It is time for policy makers to
> embrace fintech opportunities and implement policies that enable and
> encourage safe financial innovation and adoption.

Fintech and the Future of Finance: Market and Policy Implications
explores the implications of fintech and the digital transformation of
financial services for market outcomes, on the one hand, and regulation
and supervision, on the other hand---and how these interact. The report,
which provides a high-level perspective for senior policy makers, is
accompanied by notes that focus on salient issues for a more technical
audience. As the financial sector continues to transform itself, policy
trade-offs will evolve, and regulators will need to ensure that market
outcomes remain aligned with core policy objectives. Several policy
implications emerge.

> n Manage risks, while fostering beneficial innovation and competition.
>
> n Broaden monitoring horizons and reassess regulatory perimeters. n
> Review regulatory, supervisory, and oversight frameworks.
>
> n Be mindful of evolving policy trade-offs as fintech adoption
> deepens.
>
> n Monitor market structure and conduct to maintain competition. n
> Modernize and open financial infrastructures.
>
> n Ensure public money remains fit for the digital world.
>
> n Pursue strong cross-border coordination and sharing of information
> and best practices.
