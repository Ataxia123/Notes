> The key organizing framework for the discussion is *economicfrictions*

> *computing* power and cost, which have resulted in large volumes of
> newly *created* and usable data. For example, mobile phone usage has
> surged globally, social and economic activity has shifted online
> (often to platform-based businesses), and new technologies like cloud
> computing have become widely adopted.
>
> These improvements have alleviated frictions, blurred firm and

> inroads into core financial products. Available evidence shows that
> big tech firms in particular are rapidly expanding their footprint in
> finance, and can use big data in ways that reduce the need for
> collateral. Meanwhile, incumbent financial institutions have adapted
> by adopting new technologies and disaggregating their production of
> financial services to improve efficiency.

> Digital innovation could drive a range of industrial organization

>
> Digital innovation is transforming financial services. Innovations in
> financial technology such as mobile money, peer-to-peer (P2P) or
> marketplace lending, robo-advice, insurance technology (insurtech) and
> crypto-assets have emerged around the world.2 In the past decade,
> fintech has already driven greater access to and convenience of
> financial services for retail users. Meanwhile, artificial
> intelligence (AI), cloud services, and distributed ledger technology
> (DLT) are transforming wholesale markets in areas as diverse as
> financial market trading and regulatory and supervisory technology
> (regtech and suptech). A host of new firms have sprung up to apply new
> technologies to meet customer demand and most incumbents indicate that
> digital transformation is a strategic priority (Feyen et al 2021).
> Indeed, leading banks are rapidly closing gaps in digitization of
> internal processes and customer offerings, to compete with fintechs
> and the large technology (big tech) firms that have also entered the
> fray (BIS 2019; Frost et al 2019).
>
> These developments have the potential to make markets more diverse,
> competitive, efficient, and inclusive, but could also increase
> concentration. Innovation has introduced competition and increased
> inclusion, particularly in emerging markets and developing economies
> (Pazarbasioglu et al 2020; Frost et al 2021). Fintech seems to have
> thrived particularly in markets where the financial system had been
> less developed (FSB 2020; Didier et al 2021). However, the underlying
> economics of intermediation combined with new technology may lead to
> concentration among both traditional and new financial services
> providers. Monopolistic or anti-competitive behaviours by big
> technology platforms are already being scrutinized. As financial
> services move towards similar technology-driven configurations,
> regulators are grappling with questions of how best to regulate and
> supervise a landscape that is increasingly characterized by new
> players and business models; and to address potential challenges to
> financial stability, financial integrity, fair competition, and
> consumer protection (including data privacy).
>
> The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the digital transformation. In
> particular, the need for digital connectivity to replace physical
> interactions between consumers and providers, and in the processes
> that produce financial services, will be even more important as
> economies, financial services providers, businesses and individuals
> navigate the pandemic and the eventual post-COVID-19 world. For
> instance, the pandemic has already accelerated the shift to digital
> payments (Auer et al 2020a). It has also intensified e-commerce (BIS
> 2020; Alfonso et al 2021), which may benefit big tech firms and their
> activities in finance. Countries with more stringent COVID-19 policies
> and lower community mobility experienced a larger increase in
> financial app downloads in the wake of the outbreak (Didier et al
> 2021). Finally, it may be speeding up work on central bank digital
> currencies (CBDCs) (Auer et al 2020b).

> This paper examines the implications of digital innovation for market

> regulation. There have been a number of surveys of regulatory
> responses. This paper takes a step back, to look at what the economic

> transformation of finance in how innovation has enabled providers to
> address long-standing challenges of financial intermediation --
> including asymmetric information, uncertainty, incomplete markets, and
> fixed and variable costs of production. The paper describes how
> digital innovation affects these key economic frictions in finance,
> and alters the financial services value chain and industrial
> organization. The forces driving these changes, and potential outcomes
> in terms of industry structure, lead to insights for policy makers on
> how to harness the benefits of fintech, while mitigating some of the
> risks, particularly around competition and market structure. The focus
> is on economic and technological forces that apply broadly across
> financial services. It recognizes that the sector encompasses a wide

> sub-markets that might use different technologies or have different
> economic structures. These may thus diverge in market structure and

>
> 2\. Economic frictions and forces in financial services
>
> Fundamentally, financial firms, like other firms, owe their existence
> to transaction costs (Baltensperger 1980). In the absence of complete
> trust between parties, market interactions on the production side and
> the customer side are characterized by risks, due eg to
> principal-agent challenges and incomplete or asymmetric information.
> Solving these to reduce risk and create trust imposes costs on both
> institutions and consumers, including contracting, search, and
> verification costs. For example, lending is characterized by
> information asymmetries *ex ante*, as lenders need to determine the
> risk profile of potential borrowers, and *ex post*, as they need to
> monitor the repayment capacity of borrowers (Dewatripoint and Tirole
> 1994). A fundamental feature of payment markets is the need to keep
> track of payment obligations, and to verify the identity of account
> holders or the veracity of payment tokens (Kahn and Roberds 2009).
> Different actors in the payment processing chain must trust that the
> other links will not expose them to fraud or liability, and customers
> require trustworthy counterparties with which to lodge funds and
> reliable processes for their delivery. Financial market investment and
> insurance are subject to uncertainty around future outcomes, adverse
> selection, and moral hazard. Those creating investment products rely
> on sound underwriting and execution services to be able to offer a
> quality product to their customers. Customers in turn must be able to
> trust the soundness of the investments and of the operations that
> underlie their ability to buy and sell.
>
> As in other industries, internalization of activities within a single
> financial services firm overcomes principal-agent and asymmetric
> information challenges, to align interests and monitor actions. This
> ensures trusted interactions across teams. Linking deposit taking to
> lending enables close coordination of asset and liability management.
> Combining payments execution with account management allows the
> provider to confirm availability of funds before transfer instructions
> are carried out. Linking underwriting, trading, and sales allows firms
> to design new investment products in line with market conditions and
> investor preferences.
>
> The presence of uncertainty about future outcomes, for example whether
> a borrower will go bankrupt, adds further frictions. Because it is
> difficult to define a contract for all potential future states of the
> world -- and the resulting solvency status of the borrower -- markets
> are not complete in the Arrow-Debreu (1954) sense. As a

> result, resource allocations may be inefficient: some borrowers will
> have to pay higher interest rates to compensate the lender for
> expected (but not necessarily realized) losses, costly insurance may
> be required, or some loans will not be made at all. More generally,
> the difficulty of tailoring products to the precise circumstances of
> different customers, due either to asymmetric information or
> uncertainty about outcomes, means that pricing, maturity, or other
> terms will inevitably be less than perfectly suited to the
> circumstances of some clients. They may decline the offer, or the
> intermediary may deem certain segments unviable commercially. Either
> way, some customers will not be served.
>
> Financial services companies are structured to address particular
> information gaps and frictions related to intermediation. Banks
> developed to address the maturity transformation challenge resulting
> from incomplete information about future liquidity needs of
> depositors. They also address the transactional costs and risk
> management needs of intermediating investments across individuals who
> lack direct knowledge of other counterparties or information about
> economic activities taking place elsewhere. Banks diversify across
> large numbers of borrowers to better manage uncertainty of outcomes.
> Exchanges and brokers address the search and transaction costs of
> individual issuers and investors, reducing information asymmetries
> through listing requirements and publishing prices, and providing
> infrastructure and services to match and enable transactions between
> buyers and sellers who don't know each other. Because so much of the
> intermediation process is not readily visible to customers, and risks
> may only be realized after an extended period of time, the consumer
> need for trusted providers manifests more than in other industries. A
> provider that gains customer trust with one product can leverage that
> trust to offer other services.
>
> Providing these services requires not only information and *financial*
> resources, but also *real* resources. These include the labour,
> equipment, and premises to produce financial contracts, manage
> accounts, and process customer transactions. The mix of labour,
> physical capital, financial capital, and trust capital will vary by
> business type, and has been rapidly changing. Nevertheless, financial
> services production is subject, in varying degrees, to the same
> frictions that affect production in other industries, including real
> resource indivisibility and fixed costs. Thus, while financial
> intermediation is subject to unique information and transaction
> frictions, as an industry it is also subject to familiar economic
> forces observed across sectors.
>
> Basic economic forces are at play across both the financial and real
> resources deployed by financial firms. These include:
>
> â¢ *Economies of scale.* On the supply side, traditional financial
> firms have had large fixed cost investment needs for the creation and
> maintenance of back-office systems and physical distribution networks
> to connect to the consumer. There may also be fixed costs of minimum
> capital requirements and regulatory compliance operations. As in any
> industry with fixed costs, economies of scale emerge when a larger
> producer can amortize those costs over a larger customer base. Scale
> also permits the development of a diversified balance sheet to better
> manage liquidity and credit risk. Scale can reduce the marginal cost
> of risk-taking (Mester 2010) and allow better pricing and/or ability
> to serve a wider range of customers.
>
> â¢ *Economies of scope.* Also on the supply side, financial
> intermediaries enjoy economies of scope by bundling interdependent
> financial services that can be delivered through the same physical
> customer interfaces and leverage the same
>
> BIS Papers No 117 3
>
> balance sheet. Cross-selling loan products and insurance, and offering
> both asset and liability products, can create synergies and reduce
> costs. Economies of scope are further enforced by the demand side as
> many customers prefer a conveniently offered suite of products. This
> also reinforces the institution's role of gatekeeper to the customer.

> The adoption of technology is not new in the financial sector, but a
> number of constraints had defined the operating environment until
> recently. In the late 20th century, the industry was already
> characterized by a relatively high degree of computerization since
> most financial services were dematerialized.3 Only payments frequently
> required physical cash or a check, and onboarding for new products and
> services often required in-person or paper-based processes. Still,
> reaching and connecting to customers routinely required physical
> infrastructure such as branches and automated teller machines (ATMs).
> Customers wishing to transact with counterparties using other banks
> had to use expensive and sometimes slow or risky processes such as
> wire transfers. Even after the advent of digital payment systems and
> the dematerialization of securities, connectivity remained a barrier
> to entry -- an institution typically had to be licensed and part of
> the consortium of banks or brokerage houses to participate in a
> transactional network. Furthermore, data processing and storage were
> expensive, requiring the operation of bespoke mainframes and data
> centres. This limited the volume of information that could be
> gathered, stored, analysed, and exchanged to improve efficiency,
> better price risk, and tailor products to customer needs.

> Technology advances in connectivity, data processing, and storage

> Significant technology advances have taken place in two key areas that
> have contributed to the current wave of technology-based finance:

> Impact on transaction costs, information asymmetries, and market gaps
>
> Through the advances in connectivity and computing, digital innovation
> helps to alleviate transaction costs and enable a wide range of new
> financial services business models. Adoption cuts across traditional
> and new providers. Digital technologies can help reduce the costs of
> collecting, storing, processing, and exchanging information --
> including search costs, replication costs, tracking costs, and
> verification costs (Goldfarb and Tucker 2019). In finance, this can
> help borrowers to more quickly find a suitable offer on a loan, or
> help savers to find an investment product that suits their specific
> needs. Technologies can also help parties to automate verification of
> events, enabling the creation of a wider range of state-contingent
> products. For instance, an insurance client may use a phone camera or
> other remote device to document damage that results in an insurance
> claim, or a drone may verify that a field has been planted to enable
> disbursement of an agricultural loan. Blockchain technologies take
> these a level further by providing a set of underlying capabilities
> making it easier for individuals and businesses to interact on a
> peer-to-peer basis even when they do not know each other beforehand
> (trustless context). At the limit, such advances may obviate the need
> for intermediation, by enabling individuals or firms -- such as the
> lenders and borrowers in P2P and private credit markets -- to interact
> directly without the need for a bank to aggregate funds, assess
> credit, and provide ongoing monitoring and servicing functions.

> Incumbents, fintech entrants, and big techs are leveraging technology
> to address economic frictions. They can close information gaps

> â¢ Reducing information asymmetries. Classic theories of intermediation
> describe how banks address information asymmetries between borrowers
> and lenders (Aghion and Bolton 1997; HolmstrÃ¶m and Tirole 1997). They
> also discuss how residual gaps increase credit costs or restrict the
> supply of credit, both in terms of interest rates and the costs of
> ancillary activities such as attaching collateral. Better information,
> for example leveraging consumer data and analytics, could improve risk
> assessment and reduce the need for collateral as an indicator of
> creditworthiness in lending (Gambacorta et al 2020; see Box A). The

> enough transparency between users of finance and providers of funds,
> intermediation itself may not be necessary. For example, fintech
> credit models such as P2P or marketplace lending seek to directly link

> same city. On the consumer side, the marginal cost of using multiple
> financial service providers is also reduced. Technologies have become
> increasingly plug-and-play, from the advent of common internet
> communications protocols and mark-up languages, to "open banking" and
> standardized APIs that facilitate data access and exchange. Increased
> access to information about remote providers and their products and
> prices reduces search costs for users. The reduction in search and
> switching costs thus applies both to providers and individual
> customers. For example, a customer can now choose a start-up
> remittance service provider offering lower fees and ready connectivity
> to the customer's bank account, or an established social media company
> that already has the customer's trust and connectivity to friends and
> family to whom remittances are sent. Reduced search costs could
> eventually enable those who need finance to connect directly to those
> with excess funds to invest, with smart loan contracts replacing the
> monitoring provided by intermediaries. Lower search, on-boarding, and
> switching costs could make markets more competitive.
>
> Despite reduced costs, increased efficiency, and all the new data and
> computing power available, fintech remains subject to the same risks
> traditionally present in finance. Credit, liquidity, market, and
> operational risks can be reduced or transferred, but not eliminated
> completely. Market failures can result in financial instability,
> speculative bubbles, domino effects and, potentially, systemic risks
> (Frost 2020). In most markets digital finance has not reached levels
> at which it presents systemic risk, but as fintech and big tech
> finance grow, and traditional banks use similar technologies to a
> greater degree, that will shift. P2P lending in China reached
> significant volumes before the regulatory crackdown began in 2017.
> This culminated in the November 2019 requirement that all platforms

> of fintech. Big tech firms may already have reached the level of
> systemic importance (too-big-to-fail) in some economies, notably in
> China. Authorities are actively formulating appropriate regulatory
> responses to these risks (see Section 4).

> The digital transformation of finance also introduces -- or heightens
> -- cyber risks. Cybersecurity is an issue for all sectors and for
> traditional financial services providers as well as fintechs and big
> techs. The attack surface is broadening, however, as interconnectivity
> increases and the disaggregation of services introduces more links to

> involved in the provision of a single product or service, creating
> complex webs of operational dependency. These risks may have increased
> further during the COVID-19 pandemic (Aldasoro et al 2021). At the
> same time, certain core services have become more concentrated (eg

> The financial services value chain consists of four broad components:
> customer interface, back-office functions, infrastructure, and balance
> sheet. The operations that 'manufacture' financial services involve
> the first three of these. The theory of the firm in economics
> highlights transactions costs as a key determinant of whether a given

> firm (Coase 1937; Williamson 1971). Prior to the advent of fintech,
> the combination of transactions costs and economies of scale and scope
> resulted in large financial intermediaries that tended to be
> vertically and horizontally integrated, providing all four components

> modern balance sheet serves more complex functions and is optimized to
> attract a mix of retail and wholesale funds, to match assets and
> liabilities across multiple dimensions (tenor, currency, etc.) and to
> maintain adequate capital and liquidity levels. Balance sheets of
> regulated financial institutions are subject to a variety of

> As technology has reduced transaction costs, the boundaries of the

> could be more disaggregated (vertical disintegration). This has been
> taking place for decades; an example is the use of third-party ATM and
> card networks to process banking withdrawals or payments transactions.
> First, the ATM moved the transaction outside the bank branch. Then,
> connectivity and information transfer technologies enabled different
> companies to provide elements of the transaction value chain -- an
> issuing bank, a merchant processor operating a POS terminal, and a
> network operator. As a result, the customer-facing bank could focus on
> its core competencies and customers. With advances in technology, this
> process has accelerated. There is an increasing array of products and
> services that can be sourced from multiple different providers,
> combined, and offered to the customer as an integrated whole. The
> customer-facing provider might incorporate features and functions from
> external vendors, outsourcing providers, or partners. Examples include
> using third-party sales agents or internet marketplace originators,
> external credit scoring services, outsourced card issuer processing,
> and white-label integration of fintech services.
>
> Advances in information and connectivity have also led to an
> unbundling of financial services consumption (horizontal
> disintegration). Customers now have more information about different
> providers and an increased ability to interact across providers, so
> they can choose different providers for the different financial
> products they use. Similarly, providers have more access to
> information about new or potential customers, can market to them
> better, and can offer services directly. The availability of data also
> makes it easier for providers to underwrite a customer without having
> had a prior relationship, so the inherent competitive advantage of a
> single provider in offering additional products is diminished.
> Services that were once consumed from one financial institution can be
> offered by a wide range of specialized firms. Examples in both
> personal and business banking underscore this unbundling (Graph 5).
> However, even as the consumer's need for a horizontally integrated
> provider has been reduced, providers can now integrate more products
> from different providers. The outcome in terms of horizontal
> disintegration depends on individual preferences, views on
> convenience, and costs to search and assemble product sets. All of

> take out a working capital loan to obtain inventory). As such,
> embedding the financial service directly into that core activity can
> be attractive to the customer. It can even make the customer more
> aware of services about which they otherwise might not have known, or

> Infrastructure connectivity and a reduced need for physical branches

> other products or core capabilities as part of a platform offering.
> This is particularly relevant in EMDEs where the financial system is
> less developed and access to financial services is more limited. This
> affords fintechs and big techs more room to expand their financial

Box B

The data-network-activity feedback loop may explain the rapid growth of
big tech credit

The data-network-activity (DNA) feedback loop helps big tech firms to
correctly predict clients' creditworthiness, future income and
individual demands (BIS 2019). As a result, big techs can have a
competitive advantage over banks and serve firms and households that
otherwise would remain unbanked. Recent work suggests that big techs'
credit scoring applied to small vendors outperforms models based on
credit bureau ratings and traditional borrower characteristics (Frost et
al 2019; Gambacorta et al 2019). All this could represent a significant
advance in financial inclusion and help improve firms' performance (see
Luohan Academy, 2018).

Cornelli et al (2020a) find that in 2019, fintech and big tech credit
(together "total alternative credit") reached nearly USD 800 bn globally
(see Figure B1). Big tech credit has shown particularly rapid growth in
Asia (China, Japan, Korea and Southeast Asia), and some countries in
Africa and Latin America. By contrast, fintech credit volumes have
declined in 2018-19 due to market and regulatory developments in China.
Outside China, fintech credit is still growing. These alternative forms
of credit are more developed in countries with higher GDP per capita (at
a declining rate), where banking sector mark-ups are higher and where
banking regulation is less stringent. Fintech credit is also more
developed where there are fewer bank branches per capita. Moreover,
these alternative forms of credit are more developed where the ease of
doing business is higher, investor protection disclosure and the
efficiency of the judicial system are higher, the bank credit to deposit
ratio is lower, and where bond and equity markets are more developed.
Overall, both fintech and big tech credit seems to complement other
forms of credit, not to substitute for them, and may increase overall
credit access.

> The diversity of the financial sector has increased in both developed
> and emerging markets. Alongside incumbents, there are many different
> types and sizes of fintechs and big techs, offering a wide range of
> financial services. Some remain focused on a single product or
> service, while others have leveraged their initial successes to
> broaden their service offerings (eg Square and PayPal moving from
> payments to lending). Some fintechs are converting to banks, while
> others have become service providers to, or value chain partners with
> banks. Depending on licensing approaches in different jurisdictions, a

> compete largely in the same regulatory space as incumbents, but with
> modernized business models and streamlined infrastructure. Big techs
> with core markets ranging from telecommunications to logistics,
> transportation, e-commerce marketplaces, and online search add another
> set of diverse players to the industry. Incumbents are also adopting
> new technology, partnering with fintechs, setting up new digital units
> and otherwise adapting to the new environment. This
> hyper-diversification of financial services has implications for
> competition, as well as for regulation (see section 4).
>
> Fintechs have significantly increased competitive pressure by directly
> engaging with the consumer. The battle to 'own the customer' will be
> closely fought, since in most industries the links in the value chain
> closest to the customer earn the highest margins (eg European Banking
> Authority (2018), OECD (2020), Petralia (2020)). Some fintechs have

> to compete at scale. Through re-bundling, some digital-only banks may
> be able to broaden scope and compete at scale, but at the cost of
> having to maintain a broader product mix in which some products or
> customers will generate lower margins.

> Disruption may be contained in areas where fintechs themselves relying

> extant consumer protection regulations, any shortcomings such as
> unfair practices may not surface through traditional supervision

> Regulators have long debated the relationship between competition and

> competition-stability nexus (red arrow in Graph 12). One school of
> thought argues that greater market entry, or at least contestability,
> in the financial sector is desirable, as it fosters competition and
> reduces incumbents' market power. This can lead to greater efficiency
> and better outcomes for customers. It can also lead to more
> diversified activities (Amidu and Wolfe 2013) and fewer institutions
> that are individually systemically important and must be treated as
> "too-big-to-fail." Systemic importance can introduce governance
> challenges and moral hazard, as well as a financial sector that is, on
> aggregate, larger than would be economically optimal (Feldman 2010).

>
> This paper has shown that digital innovation is bringing about
> economically meaningful changes in the production of financial
> services, with implications for the industrial structure of finance.
> Improvements in *connectivity* and *computing* can help to enhance
> efficiency and competition. In many cases, financial services have
> seen an un-bundling of different products and services. At the same
> time, financial *frictions* and *forces* that drove the need for
> financial intermediators in the first place have re-asserted
> themselves. The financial sector may be tending toward a barbell
> outcome in market structure, in which large multi-product institutions
> exist alongside more specialized niche institutions.
>
> Regulatory and supervisory policy tools will have to adapt. Existing
> regulatory perimeters may not adequately cover emerging providers of
> financial services, and new players may pose challenges for day-to-day
> financial supervision. It is increasingly challenging to balance
> competition and stability, both among financial services providers and

> chains. Rules for control over data, and which data are allowable for
> specific services, will need to be defined -- ideally in a way that
> gives individuals control, balances competition and efficiency with
> privacy and consumer protection, and enhances financial inclusion. New
> forms of discrimination and bias will need to be understood and
> countered. A new balance will have to be struck across consumer
> protection, privacy considerations and stability and integrity in a
> way that respects societal preferences in different jurisdictions
> around the world, and within different societies. Monetary policy,
> systemic stability, and consumer protection tools, which have been
> left largely beyond the scope of this paper, may also need to adapt.
> Challenges include access to lender of last resort programs by new
> providers, stabilizing credit markets in which non-bank players become
> major lenders, and maintaining the viability of deposit insurance
> programs where new players become large.
>
> Authorities need to be intentional with respect to market structure.
> Prior notions around the trade-offs between competition and stability
> need to be re-examined. Longstanding precepts on the separation of
> banking and commerce are already being upended. Existing approaches to
> competition policy and antitrust may not be well-suited to digital
> financial services, where measures of pricing and concentration for
> one market or firm may have become less informative. The nature of
> contestability must be understood anew in markets driven by increasing
> returns to scale but also increasingly low entry barriers for niche
> services. The desirability of a barbell market configuration will
> depend in part on consumer behaviours and skills that determine
> switching costs in a given market. Market forces are already being
> shaped by minimum capital, licensing requirements, activity
> restrictions and other policies. Pretending that market forces are
> just running their course is inaccurate at best, and at worst could
> lead to negative outcomes for consumers and macro stability.
>
> Several authorities are taking promising policy measures to mitigate
> trade-offs. Recent entity-based measures around big techs, such as the
> proposals in the EU, UK, US and China can take a more ex ante approach
> to address risks, prevent anticompetitive behaviours, and in the
> process promote a level playing field. Data privacy protections and
> data mobility requirements can support consumer protection and may
> also promote competition. Still, a societal debate will be needed on
> what types of data should be permissible for use in financial services
> and when privacy rules can be relaxed in the service of stability.
>
> To tread into this new territory effectively, and to balance the
> necessary policy goals, authorities will need to collaborate. At the
> domestic level, central banks and other financial sector regulators
> need to cooperate with industry regulators (eg for telecoms and other
> utilities that may offer financial services) as well as competition
> and data protection authorities. At the international level,
> authorities are working together to share expertise on financial
> regulation of both new entrants and incumbents, and to coordinate
> policies. This becomes ever more important given the cross-border
> spillovers of anti-trust and data governance decisions, and the
> potential to improve service efficiency through harmonization of
> standards in areas such as cybercrime prevention, data protection, and
> interoperability (World Bank 2021). Collaboration can help to ensure
> regulatory consistency and peer learning between countries, and
> ultimately higher welfare for their populations.
