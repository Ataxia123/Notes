The included React-based demo application offers a firsthand experience visualizing Stablecoin Studio's capabilities.

### Robust Administration & Compliance Configurations

Stablecoin Studio includes Hedera-native token administration functionalities, enabling issuers to burn, mint, freeze, wipe, and pause stablecoins with ease. Account-based permissions, like native KYC account flags, provide compliance configurations when connecting Stablecoin Studio to custody providers and KYC/AML services.

### Proof-of-Reserve for Treasury Management

Stablecoin Studio offers issuers built-in proof-of-reserve functionality that delivers provability in treasury management. Utilize existing internal systems or seamlessly integrate with on-chain oracles to manage stablecoin treasury and token issuance programmability.
