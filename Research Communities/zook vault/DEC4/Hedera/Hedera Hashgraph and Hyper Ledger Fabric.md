Yes, Hedera Hashgraph and Hyperledger Fabric can be used together. Hyperledger Fabric is an open-source blockchain framework primarily designed for enterprise use cases, focusing on permissioned networks and modular architecture. Hedera Hashgraph, on the other hand, is a public distributed ledger technology that provides high throughput and fast consensus.

While both technologies have different underlying mechanics and architecture, it is possible to integrate them to leverage their respective strengths. For example, organizations using Hyperledger Fabric for their private blockchain can utilize Hedera Hashgraph for additional services such as public auditability, interoperability with other networks, or leveraging the Hedera Consensus Service (HCS) for event streaming between networks.

Integrating Hedera Hashgraph and Hyperledger Fabric would require some development work to establish communication protocols and connectors between the two systems. This integration can enable a hybrid solution that combines the privacy and control of Hyperledger Fabric with the scalability and public features offered by Hedera Hashgraph.
