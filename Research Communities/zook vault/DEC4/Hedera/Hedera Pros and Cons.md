| Hbar Economics                |Monetary value, network fuel, and governance - provides flexibility and control over resources  | Fixed supply can cause scarcity and high prices in the long run if demand exceeds supply                          |
| Hashgraph Protocol            | Faster, fairer, and more secure due to its asynchronous BFT consensus algorithm  | Complexity can increase the learning curve for developers                                                             |
| Privacy and Data Protection   |  Ensures secure transactions and preserves user confidentiality                                | The need to balance transparency and privacy can be a complex task
| Data Privacy with HCS         | Allows compliance with privacy regulations and laws                                           | Strict privacy rules could limit some functionalities                                                            |
| Hedera Decentralization       | Provides robustness and security for the network, prevents central point of failure | Implementing true decentralization can be challenging due to technical and regulatory hurdles                     |
| Hedera Consensus Service      | Provides cheap, fast, and secure transactions                                                 | The service's reliance on Hedera's governance model may not be suitable for every type of decentralized application |
| Tokenization on Hedera        | Allows the creation of network-native tokens, thus enhancing applicability of use-cases | Different regulatory environments worldwide can cause complexities in token design and issuance                   |
| Hedera as a Public Network    | Transparent governance model ensures trust and stability                                      | Concentration of power in decision making with the governing council could be seen as not truly decentralized     |
