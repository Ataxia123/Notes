## Hedera

Hedera is the most used enterprise-grade public network for you to make your digital world exactly as it should be – yours. HBAR is the native, energy-efficient cryptocurrency of Hedera that powers the decentralized economy. Whether you are a startup or enterprise, a creator or consumer, Hedera goes beyond blockchain for developers to create the next era of fast, fair, and secure DLT applications.  

## Hedera Hashgraph

Hedera Hashgraph is a 3rd generation DLT framework based on a proof-of-stake (PoS) public network that achieves highest levels of security with asynchronous byzantine fault tolerance (ABFT), powered by the Hashgraph consensus algorithm. Unlike most other platforms, Hedera isn’t built on conventional blockchains but rather an entirely novel type of DLT platform known as **“Hashgraph”**, with blazing-fast transaction speeds and incredibly low bandwidth consumption. By combining high-throughput, low fees, and finality in seconds, Hedera leads the way for the future of public ledgers.
