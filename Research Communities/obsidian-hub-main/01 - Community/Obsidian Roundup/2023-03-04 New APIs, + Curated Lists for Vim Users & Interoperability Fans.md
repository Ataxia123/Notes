### Pending (as of Friday morning)

__Note: Not all new plugins are available in the community list yet, as they need to go through code review first. You can manually install plugins that aren't in the community list yet by using the [Beta Reviewer's Auto-update Tool](https://github.com/TfTHacker/obsidian42-brat?ref=eleanorkonik.com).

## Housekeeping

* While getting ready to do my taxes (groan), I trawled through my purchase history & wrote up [a list of the stuff I'm glad I bought](https://www.eleanorkonik.com/some-stuff-im-surprisingly-happy-i-bought/). None of these are affiliate links, I just thought I'd share which pens, notebooks, blankets, cooking supplies, etc really felt worth it.
* [Financial supporters](https://www.eleanorkonik.com/#/portal) of this newsletter are now [able to view](https://eleanorkonik.com/thanks?ref=eleanorkonik.com) the zip file of my [newly updated notes, featuring a condensed folder structure](https://publish.obsidian.md/eleanorkonik/?ref=eleanorkonik.com), the Discord server where I mess around with [image generating AI bots](https://www.midjourney.com/?ref=eleanorkonik.com), and record quick notes-to-self while out and about, as well as commentary on [links I share](https://rw-discord-bot-production.herokuapp.com/guilds/links/954068589885923389?ref=eleanorkonik.com). It's a relatively small community, but a decent insight into my process and a nice way to chat with like-minded folks. The [Thanks page](https://www.eleanorkonik.com/thanks/) also now features a new PDF compilation of my (very) short stories. Thank you to everyone who helps me afford to maintain this newsletter! Tax season is definitely a stark reminder of how much it helps :)
