You can still use this to test out your plugin in numerous ways, such as if you are building an alternate rendering system, or statistics, or any such thing where having data in the notes (even if that data is nonsensical) is useful.
* If anyone was keeping an eye out for a small project on a small plugin to get their feet wet with Obsidian plugin development, here's one: [let users designate folders to extract text into](https://github.com/scambier/obsidian-text-extractor/issues/3?ref=obsidian-iceberg).

## Ancillary Tools

* Here's a tool to help [open, create, and update Obsidian notes from your terminal](https://github.com/Yakitrak/obsidian-cli?ref=obsidian-iceberg).

## Housekeeping

* In theory The Great Newsletter Consolidation of 2023 is over, which should make things immensely easier on me in August when I've got a newborn and a 3 year old at home and a job I _don't_ want to take 2 years of leave from. To that end, links should now redirect from `obsidianroundup.org` to `eleanorkonik.com` -- unfortunately when I tried to get `obsidianroundup.org` to redirect straight to the "obsidian roundup" specific page at `https://www.eleanorkonik.com/tag/roundup/` everything _else_ broke horribly 🙁
* Most RSS feeds should have redirected correctly, but if you're getting flooded with content you don't want because the old RSS feed now has all the content for `eleanorkonik.com` remember that you can always subscribe directly to _just_ the weekly Obsidian Roundup itself and not any of my other essays or articles by using `https://www.eleanorkonik.com/tag/roundup/rss/` -- this works with all the other tags, too, which you can check out on the [navigation page](https://www.eleanorkonik.com/tags/). Incidentally, the Navigation page also shows how many posts there are in each category; looks like we're coming up on our 100th edition on March 25 🤯
* If anybody is signed up to emails wants the extra essays, just [sign in](https://www.eleanorkonik.com/#/portal/signin) at the website (there's no password, Ghost uses email authentication) and click the relevant checkbox. This week's edition for everyone was about historical [cleaning methods](https://www.eleanorkonik.com/cleaning/) from around the world, from lotus leaves to bronze knives. The financial supporters edition was about [my favorite productivity app that isn't a productivity app](https://www.eleanorkonik.com/my-favorite-productivity-app-that-isnt-a-productivity-app/) 🦁
