# 2023-02-18: Publish updates & highlights syncing
Canvas updates, zen mode, improved podcast handling, & the ability to mass delete tags.

## Obsidian Updates

On February 23rd 2023, the design of Publish sites will be updated to the same standard as Obsidian 1.0. Here's the [theming guide](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/publish-theming-guide/54445?ref=eleanorkonik.com).

[Insider 1.1.13](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/obsidian-release-v1-1-13-insider-build/54372?ref=eleanorkonik.com) & [1.1.14](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/obsidian-release-v1-1-14-insider-build/54595?ref=eleanorkonik.com)

* Canvas: content from text cards will now appear as results in global searches.
* Canvas: Added support for resizing multiple cards at once.
* Canvas: Added “Readonly” mode for canvases. While in read-only mode, a canvas and its contents cannot be modified.
* Canvas: Groups can now have a background image.
* Canvas: Added support for YouTube timestamped links.
* Canvas: Added “convert to file” command to the command palette.
* Canvas: Added new setting to specify the default canvas file location.
* Canvas: Cards can be resized regardless of zoom level.
* Canvas: recent files and recent attachments are now kept track of separately, so the attachments modal should be filled with more useful options.
* The vim Codemirror extension has been updated to include all the latest upstream fixes and patches.

[Mobile Insider v1.4.2-93](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/obsidian-mobile-v1-4-2-build-93-insider-build/54596?ref=eleanorkonik.com) brings mobile up to date with Obsidian Desktop 1.1.14.

## Plugin News

### New in Community Plugins

_These plugins went through code review and are now available in Obsidian's plugin list._ For the full list, check out the [plugin stats page](https://obsidian-plugin-stats.vercel.app/new?ref=eleanorkonik.com).

* [Double Colon Conceal](https://github.com/msrch/obsidian-double-colon-conceal?ref=eleanorkonik.com) by `@msrch`  will display double colon (i.e. Dataview inline fields) as a single colon in reading view (preview mode) for more natural experience.

### Pending (as of Friday morning)

_Note: Not all new plugins are available in the community list yet, as they need to go through code review first. You can manually install plugins that aren't in the community list yet by using the [Beta Reviewer's Auto-update Tool](https://github.com/TfTHacker/obsidian42-brat?ref=eleanorkonik.com). Note, though, that this is not as safe as waiting for them to go through code review._
