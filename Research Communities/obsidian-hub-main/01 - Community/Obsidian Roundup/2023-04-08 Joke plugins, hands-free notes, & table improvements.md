# 2023-04-08: Joke plugins, hands-free notes, & table improvements
Tasks styling, a plugin for day trading, multi-column embeds & callouts, and a method for taking notes about people.

## In The Community

* This year's April Fools joke was Obsidian's first assistant - [Gemmy, the Obsidian Unhelper](https://github.com/ericaxu/Gemmy?ref=eleanorkonik.com). Not sure if an AI assistant is going to be helpful in your workflow? Don't worry, they've eliminated the guesswork for you because Gemmy is 100% going to be unhelpful. Gemmy seeks validation by randomly saying things every now and then, and pops out to [motivate you](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1171143/229297494-8a0cae3f-4c8e-47a9-801b-dd1c52dfc917.png?ref=eleanorkonik.com) when you have stopped typing for long enough. There are also several complementary new emojis in the Obsidian Discord.
* Other fun April Fools jokes include the [M.U.M.M.Y method](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/ultimate-pkm-the-m-u-m-m-y-method/57341?ref=eleanorkonik.com) for organizing a personal knowledge base and the [Minimalister](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/minimal-snippets-season-1/57358?ref=eleanorkonik.com) CSS snippet to make all problems with your complex writing fade right away.
* The [mobile section of the forum](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/closing-the-mobile-section-of-the-forum/57277?ref=eleanorkonik.com) is now closed as a bit of spring cleaning; relevant posts have been relocated to other sections like Feature Requests, Bug Reports, and Help.

## Obsidian Updates

* [Insider v1.2.1](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/obsidian-release-v1-2-1-insider-build/57286?ref=eleanorkonik.com) & [v1.2.2](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/obsidian-release-v1-2-2-insider-build/57488?ref=eleanorkonik.com) improved the functionality for managing included and excluding folders, the bookmarks plugin, and added a command to close tabs except the selected one. There were also several bugfixes and other improvements.
