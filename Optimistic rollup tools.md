## Optimistic rollup tools

Optimistic rollups are useful solutions for scaling dApps and interacting with smart contracts in a more cost-effective and efficient manner. But first, you'll need various tools to use optimistic rollups easily _and_ safely. 

Here are various optimistic rollup tools for developers and end-users:

### Cross-chain bridges to optimistic layer 2 blockchains

While optimistic rollups are built on top of Ethereum’s base layer, assets on both chains are not natively compatible. However, you can transfer funds from an L1 chain, like Ethereum, to an optimistic rollup [using cross-chain bridges](https://www.alchemy.com/overviews/cross-chain-bridges):

Here are examples of bridges connecting L1 chains and different L2 rollups:
