[[Quickstart Guide]]


Goal: 
- Create a LK99 knowledge graph to facilitate the coordination of efforts in pushing said research forward.
- leverage Obsidian.md + Carlosâ€™ AI embeds to visual and establish said coordination graph. (May have potential synergies with Lateral.io)
- Create a DeSci LK99 github repo that will underlie the DeSci LK99 obsidian.md graph.
    - it will be the place where groups push their respective notes too which will then feed the consolidate DeSci LK99 graph

DSW Tasks:
- Create Github repo to consolidate that the groups can push their LK99 notes to (Carolina)
- Create a DSW Obsidian.md 
- Reach out to Lateral.io and see if they would like to come on board (Jelani)
- Draft a workshop to explain to the research groups how they can contribute their notes ( @At0xNQ @JBate7 )
- Write a short but engaging piece on what we are doing here as a CTA to draw more interest.
- Reach out to and share the write up with Eiri and other players potentially interested in contributing (Jelani, Josh, etc)
  
  ### Project Domains
  
Split the #superConductor tag into different domains we should approach to solve it as a project

---
Based on your notes, the #superConductor project could be approached from the following domains:

#Material_Science: This domain would focus on the synthesis and analysis of the LK-99 material. It would involve understanding the properties of Lanarkite and Copper Phosphide, the materials used in the synthesis, and optimizing the synthesis process to improve the superconducting properties of LK-99. [[MaterialScience]]

#Physics: This domain would focus on understanding the superconducting mechanism of LK-99. It would involve studying the formation of Cooper pairs in the CuO planes of the material and how this leads to superconductivity at room temperature. [[Physics]]

#Engineering: This domain would focus on the practical applications of LK-99. It would involve exploring how the material can be used in various fields such as energy transmission and quantum computing. [[Engineering]]

#Project_Management: This domain would focus on the coordination and execution of the project. It would involve tasks such as setting timelines, allocating resources, and managing the project team.[[ProjectManagement]]

#Fundraising: This domain would focus on securing the necessary funding for the project. It would involve tasks such as preparing a project proposal, identifying potential funders, and pitching the project to them.[[FundRaising]]

#Communication: This domain would focus on disseminating the findings of the project. It would involve tasks such as writing scientific papers, presenting at conferences, and communicating with the public and other stakeholders. [[Communication]]
