# NerdOS Delegation Update


![](https://i.imgur.com/2cJ9veL.jpg)


### Introduction

As stated in our delegation proposal post our main goal is to showcase EthOS through easy to fork implementations of the protocol that showcase its power and help us drive the adoption of EthOS. With that in mind we have been working on several initiatives to do just that and keep building like we always have.

## NerdOS x BuidlGuidl
### EthOS-Scaffold Starter Kit

BuidlGuidl is a collective of web3 builders that use scaffold-eth as a common development framework. The BuidlGuidl is incentivizing builders to create using this framework via streams that are deliverded upon proof of continued work in a project.

In order to make it simple to start working with EthOS we are going to create a series of starter kits that can be forked into any product. We are going to start by creating a kit to have your own front end for your covenants farm.

#### BuidlGuidl Grant!

Our delegation recieved 10ETH in funding to bootstrap our development we will submit a proposal linking to this post to forward 2.5 ETH to the BuidlGuidl multisig in order to pay out a stream for builders who work with EthOS in their submitted builds. This includes helping out 


### NerdOS Delegation Developer funding

In order to be able to complete our stated goals we want to guarantee incentives for  core contributors that can coordinate the work required to ship our deliverables. The funding we have recieved to bootstrap the delegation will be used to compensate the work done to as tracked through our deWork page. We will submit a coordinape report along with the proposal to retrieve the funds from the delegation.
 
## Nerd Fungible Tokens

Nerds love NFTs. We have created 2 collections of 10,000 AI nfts regenz.io and ai-universe.io to explore the latest in Synthography. We have also used Items to create a trading fund which owns a checkmark doodle.

We are going to keep experimenting with Items in all of our products. We have designed ai-universe.io to include the prompt as metadata attributes which allows us to use this collection to make our own Items. We plan to create incentivized pools for both Superheroes and Supervillains by deploying covenants that yield NERD tokens for liquidity provision on uniswapV3 using wrapped AI-Universe tokens.


## NERD token updates

Over a longer period of time the intention is to migrate the NERD DFO into an EthOS guild. Until we can do that through the front end we will work on deepending the liquidity of the token by increasing the distribution through a set of covenants. 

The goal of these farms is going to be to deepen the liquidity of the Nerd ecosystem as a whole including: $TRDL, vBTC, our structured products such as the vNFT fund. We also plan to incentivize liquidity for our upcoming ITEM decks using our latest collection @AI_UniverseNFT as well as @RegenzNFT


## Deliverables

- Scaffold-EthOS starter kits for Covenant farms
- BuidlGuidl grant allocation for EthOS buidlrs
- AI_Universe Decks for Univ3 liquidity incentives
- NERD covenants & token distribution update
