" The purported properties of the material labeled “LK-99” are incredible. Originally synthesised in 1999, not only is it RTP, but the critical temperature is actually 127°C – above the boiling temperature of water. "

The synthesis method is also shockingly simple: 

**Finely grind and mix Lanarkite (Pb2(SO4)O) and Copper Phosphide (Cu3P) and bake it at 925°C in a vacuum chamber for a day.** 

The ability to discover and synthesise it has theoretically been available since the industrial revolution. Now, one should be able to do it in a garage or home lab.

The note titled "fullPaper" is a detailed scientific paper on the synthesis and analysis of a superconducting material with a modified-lead apatite (MLA) structure, specifically Pb10-xCux(PO4)6O, also known as LK-99®. The material exhibits superconductivity at room temperature and atmospheric pressure, a significant achievement in the field of superconductivity.

Key highlights from the paper include:

1. Synthesis: The material was synthesized using the solid-state method. The process involved three steps, including the creation of Lanarkite, the synthesis of Cu3P, and the final transformation into Pb10-xCux(PO4)6O.

2. Analysis: The structure and crystallinity of the synthesized material were analyzed using X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements. The analysis revealed that the material has a hexagonal structure and exhibits volume contraction due to the substitution of Pb with Cu.

3. Superconductivity: The superconducting properties of the material were analyzed using magnetic susceptibility measurements. The material exhibited a superconducting transition at room temperature, which is a significant achievement as most superconductors only exhibit this property at extremely low temperatures.

4. Theoretical Analysis: The paper also includes a theoretical analysis of the superconducting mechanism of the material. It proposes that the superconductivity is due to the formation of Cooper pairs in the CuO planes of the material.

5. Future Work: The paper concludes with a discussion on future work, which includes optimizing the synthesis process to improve the superconducting properties of the material and exploring its potential applications in various fields such as energy transmission and quantum computing.

The most notable aspect of the paper is the discovery of room-temperature superconductivity in the synthesized material, which could have far-reaching implications in the field of superconductivity.
