Game State:

1. Location: The party is currently engaged in combat near the entrance of a cave believed to be occupied by the Redbrands, a gang of bandits. The town of Phandalin is nearby.

2. Characters: 

- Elys Shadowcloak: A stealthy rogue trained in tracking and deciphering clues, currently in hiding to avoid direct combat.
- Thalor Windwhisper: An elven ranger, currently engaged with a group of three goblins.
- Varis: A cleric of Bahamut, staying near the fringes of combat offering support.
- Ulthan & Josh: Two player characters, currently unbeknownst to the rest of the group, have been captured and taken inside the cave by the Redbrands.

3. Enemies: 

- Three goblins, engaged in combat with Thalor.
- A group of Redbrands, who have discovered Ulthan and Josh's trail and have moved into the cave with their prisoners.

4. Pending Decisions: The party must decide their next course of action: continue the fight with the goblins, pursue the Redbrands to try and rescue Ulthan and Josh, or devise a way to handle both.

5. Narrative Development: The earlier simple escort mission to safeguard Gundren Rockseeker's supplies and search for Gundren's missing partner, Sildar, has now spiraled into a more complex situation with the party splitting and an encounter with the Redbrands, a known menace to the region.

6. Initiative order for the next round: 

- Goblins: 17
- Redbrands: 14
- Thalor Windwhisper: 12
- Elys Shadowcloak: 7
- Varis: 6

With the tension escalating, the players must decide what to do next and how they will handle the intertwining threats of the goblins and the Redbrands.
