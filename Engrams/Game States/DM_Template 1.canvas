An orc casting magic was not a sight they had expected - or ever seen.\n\nThe Redbrand leader, a burly brute named Sark, scowls at the emergence of this unexpected player.

He reluctantly agrees to Locke’s plan, allowing his fear to dictate his decision for once. \"Alright, fall back!\", he orders his band.\n\nDespite their apparent fear and lack of preparedness for magical assault, the Redbrands attempt to regroup, pulling back towards the cave. The adventurers and goblins momentarily forgotten, the band focuses their attention entirely on the new threat - the one they never saw coming.\n\nThe presence of Jacamein and his magic has turned the tides of the battle dramatically. The Redbrands must regroup and reanalyze their strategy. The chaos fuels the fire of the clash, setting the stage for a significant, exhilarating confrontation.\n\nThis provides an opportunity for the adventurers to strategically plan their actions, while the Redbrands are retreating and regrouping.

Thalor, Elys, and Varis continue their engagement with the three goblins (each 7/7 HP).\n\n2. The Redbrands (8 in total, HP unknown) have secured the cave and are presumed to have taken their prisoners, Ulthan, and Josh, inside the cave. They are unaware of Ulthan and Josh's existing tie with the adventurers.\n\n3. Jacamein, a newly freed captive of the Redbrands, is readying himself to join the fight. His intentions and affiliations are currently unclear to both the adventurers and the Redbrands.\n\nThe adventurers now find themselves prioritizing their objectives from multiple fast-moving targets. Will they choose to continue head-on against the goblins, or will they divert their attention to the Redbrands moving into the cave?

The normally stoic and robust warrior feels a mixture of frustration, intrigue, and determination brewing inside him.\n\nUlthan's Current Inner State:\n\n1. **Frustration**: Ulthan is used to being the protector, the front line in any skirmish. Being a prisoner, unable to assist his friends, brings a wave of irritation and helplessness. \n\n2. **Intrigue**: The entrance of the orc mage, Jacamein, brings a spark of curiosity to Ulthan. He's aware of the orc mage's captivity, having noticed him during his own capture. He's intrigued by the orc's sudden display of power and willingness to help, wondering what his motivations might be. \n\n3. **Determination**: Despite the situation, Ulthan is unyielding. His determination to escape and aide his friends has grown stronger now that he's closer to the enemy's lair. His mind is at work, formulating a plan for a possible break out.\n\n Ulthan's focus is divided between observing the battle outside, where he sees his friends engaged with the goblins, and his immediate surrounding within the cave, where he seeks a chance to escape. Ulthan's underlying anger against the Redbrands serves as a constant fuel to his determination.","id":"1ede61529864acf5","x":520,"y":19711,"width":633,"height":599,"color":"6"},

But then he glances nervously back at his tribe members, huddled by a crag, \"But we can't fight them alone.\" \n\nIf you want to press this advantage and try to rally the goblins, you could use your next action to attempt another Persuasion check or find other ways to convince them. \n\nAs for escaping deeper into the cave, with the current state of unrest, it seems like a feasible option, assuming you want to continue in that direction.

They are armed with shortswords and one of them is carrying a crossbow.\n\n2. **Environment**: The cave's walls are jagged, and there are several large stalactites and stalagmites scattered around the cave, providing occasional cover. There's a faint glow emanating from deeper within. You see a narrower passage leading in that direction.\n\n3. **Other Prisoners**: There are five other prisoners, all looking desolate and extremely terrified. Your fellow captive, Josh, is by your side. He trusts you, looking to you for guidance.\n\n4. **Miscellaneous**: You can feel a slight draught coming from deeper within the cave, suggesting another possible exit.\n\nIt seems your best opportunity lies in forming a coordinated escape, perhaps during a distraction.

Remember that unless you have Proficiency in Persuasion, your total roll will be the number you roll plus your Charisma modifier.

Ulthan can occasionally hear the strange sounds: a distant dripping of water, the faint rustling of some unknown creatures in the dark, and the whispering draught that initially hinted at a possible additional exit.\n\nThere's a sense of foreboding undercurrent in the stale cave air. The shadows stretch and distort along the rocky walls, merging and twisting into ambiguous shapes that play tricks with his vision. There's an uneasy quiet punctuated only by his own steady breathing and footsteps.\n\nAhead of him, one of the narrower passageways catches his attention: it's veiled in an otherworldly green glow. The surrounding cave walls are etched with both natural formations and conspicuous markings, possibly warnings or signs left by the goblins. \n\nBehind him, the commotion of the potential goblin revolt against the Redbrands continues, their fervour still echoing down the tunnels.\n\nRight now, Ulthan is smack in the middle of two choices: he can either delve further into the mysterious illuminated green passage, or he can head back to join the rebellion against the Redbrands.

		{"chat_role":"assistant","type":"text","text":"Certainly. Klarg and Yeemik's most notorious escapades often involved raids targeting vulnerable settlements to expand their territory and power. Here are a couple of their most infamous:\n\n**1. The Sacking of Stonetown:** This quiet farming town nestled in the foothills had never seen a goblin nor bugbear before the night Klarg and Yeemik came to town. They pillaged the town under the cover of darkness, leaving not a single house or granary untouched. Stonetown was left in ruins and its populace decimated. The heavy loss caused an influx of refugees to nearby settlements, resulting in an overall instability in the region.\n\n**2. The Torngal Ambush:** Torngal was a regular caravan route often frequented by adventurers and merchants alike. It was here that Klarg and Yeemik concocted an elaborate ambush plan, using a false distress signal to lure the unsuspecting caravans into the jaws of their waiting forces. Many who traveled fell victim to their scheme. The road was soon feared and avoided, resulting in a significant decline in trade in that area.\n\n**3. The Siege of Lanir Outpost:** This strategic site was a fortified outpost tasked with keeping an eye on and fighting off goblinoid threats from the woods. Determined to rid themselves of a persistent thorn in their side, Klarg and Yeemik planned and executed a full-scale attack on the outpost, catching the occupants by surprise. The outpost was brutally razed, greatly hampering the human efforts to control the goblinoid menace.\n\nThese actions, while violently destructive, elevated Klarg and Yeemik to infamous status within their clan and confirmed their reputations as one of the most formidable and feared duos in the region.","id":"7c20750fd4ea11fe","x":9600,"y":6149,"width":800,"height":594,"color":"6"},

His senses become sharper, more attuned to the natural world and creatures in his vicinity.\n\nCuriously, he focuses on the cave's inhabitants, waiting for any sign from even the smallest creature.
