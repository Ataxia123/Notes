Algebraic notation is a way of representing chess moves using a combination of letters and numbers. Here are some easy-to-understand instructions for using algebraic notation:

1. Each square on the chessboard is represented by a unique combination of a letter and a number. The letter indicates the file (column) and the number indicates the rank (row).

2. The letters used for the files are a, b, c, d, e, f, g, and h, starting from the left side of the board (from White's perspective).

3. The numbers used for the ranks are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8, starting from the bottom of the board (again, from White's perspective).

4. To make a move, you need to specify the starting square and the ending square of the piece you want to move. For example, if you want to move a pawn from e2 to e4, you would write "e2e4".

5. If two pieces of the same type can move to the same square, you might need to add additional information to specify which piece is being moved. For example, if there are two knights that can move to the square g1, you would write "Ngg1" to indicate the knight on the g-file.

6. For capturing a piece, you use the "x" symbol between the starting and ending squares. For example, if a bishop captures a piece on d5, you would write "Bxd5".

7. If a move results in a check, you can indicate this by adding a "+" symbol at the end of the move. For example, if a queen checks the opponent's king, you would write "Qxf7+".

8. If a move leads to a checkmate, you can use the "#" symbol at the end of the move. For example, if a rook checkmates the opponent's king, you would write "Rxd8#".

Remember, these are just the basics of algebraic notation. There are additional symbols and notations for special moves like castling and pawn promotions.
