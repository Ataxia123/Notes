Perfect! Moving your knight to f3 not only develops a piece and prepares for castling, it's also an attack on Black's pawn on e5. Here's the updated board:

```
8 r n b q k b n r
7 p p p p   p p p
6
5         p
4         P
3           N
2 P P P P   P P P
1 R N B Q K B   R
  a b c d e f g h
```

It's Black's turn to move. For example, if Black decides to defend his pawn and develops his knight with "Knight to c6", the board would look like this:

```
8 r   b q k b n r
7 p p p p   p p p
6       n
5         p
4         P
3           N
2 P P P P   P P P
1 R N B Q K B   R
  a b c d e f g h
```

You're up. Please suggest your next move.
