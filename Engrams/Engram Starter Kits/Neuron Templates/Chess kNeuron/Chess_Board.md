```Prompt
> use the FEN and algebraic letter notation to create a markdown table of the current board position. Each piece must always be in it's correct location according to the FEN/updated position. after every update check each square to ensure it is the correct piece and that each square has a piece if the FEN dictates it should. co-ordinates start bottom left a1 with the white player on the bottom and black at the top. each cell in the table must centre align its contents. your response must only include the table.

> the header and first column of the table are not positions on the board and should not be counted as squares.

> Starting FEN: rnbqkbnr/pppppppp/8/8/8/8/PPPPPPPP/RNBQKBNR w KQkq - 0 1
