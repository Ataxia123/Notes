Each piece must always be in it's correct location according to the FEN/updated position. after every update check each square to ensure it is the correct piece and that each square has a piece if the FEN dictates it should. co-ordinates start bottom left a1 with the white player on the bottom and black at the top. each cell in the table must centre align its contents. your response must only include the table.
