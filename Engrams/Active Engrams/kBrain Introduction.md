# kBrain Documentation: An Introduction

Welcome to the kBrain Documentation, a comprehensive guide aimed at explaining the core elements and fundamental concepts underlying our unique system.

The intelligence behind kBrain is driven by **Knowledge Engrams**, composite units of information built from **kNeurons**. Each kNeuron embodies a specific function in the processed data, making it an essential part of the building blocks of an engram.

The formation of an engram begins with a **Study Question**, which serves as the seed that sets the context and direction of research. Structured around this question, kNeurons interact with research data applying the principles of the scientific method, which ensures reliable and valid knowledge generation.

In this collaborative interaction of kNeurons, **Coherence** emerges as a critical metric. It represents the logical and orderly relation between these diverse components of an engram, playing a crucial role in achieving generalizable and robust knowledge embeddings.

Finally, we acknowledge the vital role of the **Human Operator** in our system. While our engrams are the result of sophisticated processes, human expertise is irreplaceable in verifying the logic, consistency, and relevance of these constructs. This validation step substantially contributes to the quality, reliability, and usability of our engrams across a wide range of applications.

Stay tuned as we delve deeper into the fascinating system of kBrain in the following sections of this documentation. Whether you are a researcher, a data scientist, or someone who is interested in how information is synthesized into robust knowledge structures, we have insights ready for you. Welcome aboard!
