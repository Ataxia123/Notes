| Engram Definition | Engram is a unit of cognitive information imprinted in a physical substance, like the brain or other biological tissue, in response to external stimuli. It's a biophysical or biochemical change which stores memories. 
| Overview Engram   | Many types of memories exist and their physical location within the brain depends on the system mediating the encoding of memory. Brain parts such as the cerebellum, striatum, cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and amygdala play major roles in memory storage. Various studies show that specific physical activation of certain small subpopulations of brain cells can trigger high-level cognitive behaviors like the recall of a specific memory.
