In this context, an engram is a composite of kNeurons formed around a study question which serves as the seed. Each kNeuron plays a specific functional role in processing and integrating research data regarding the study question.

| Knowledge Elements | Definitions |
|----|----|
| Knowledge Engram | A unit of knowledge built from kNeurons, organized around a study question |
| Study Question | The seed that gives direction to the research and the formation of the engram |
| Knowledge Neuron (kNeuron) | Functional units within the engram, tasked with processing and integrating research data |

The study question, being the seed, ensures that the engram is created following the scientific method. It guides the kNeurons in their interactions with the research data, leading to the formation of an engram. This engram is a dynamic unit of knowledge that provides comprehensive information based on the initial study question.
