Coherence is an essential metric for engrams and it plays a crucial role in achieving generalizable embeddings. It can be defined as the logical and orderly relation between the different parts of an engram.

| Coherence           | The logical and consistent relation between the parts of an engram |

The greater the coherence, the better the different kNeurons are able to communicate, coordinate, and form generalizable embeddings of information. A perfectly coherent engram means that all elements are interrelated and work together seamlessly to create an understanding that is more than the sum of its parts.

High coherence within an engram leads to robust and meaningful embeddings. These embeddings are generalizable as they capture the patterns, relationships, and contexts prevailing in the data, and they are capable of transferring this understanding to new, unseen data.

In essence, coherence ensures an engram's ability to represent data in such a way that it can easily be applied to new data and contexts, making it a vital metric in the process of knowledge extraction and application.
