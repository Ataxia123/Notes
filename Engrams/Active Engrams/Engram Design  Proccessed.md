# Knowledge Engram Starter Kit Design Document

## Objective
The objective of this design document is to outline the specifications and components required to create an optimal knowledge engram starter kit. The kit should provide users with the necessary tools and resources to understand, create, and explore knowledge engrams effectively.

## Components
1. **Guidebook**: The kit should include a comprehensive guidebook that introduces the concept of knowledge engrams, explains their role in knowledge graphs, and provides step-by-step instructions on how to create and manipulate engrams.

-> Introduction (README HAS A LOT OF STUFF)
	-> The issues with learning
	-> Introduction to the scientific method
	-> Why structuring data is important for coherence
	-> Knowledge graphs
	-> The scientific method
	-> Engrams  

3. **Sample Engrams**: The kit should include a collection of pre-existing knowledge engrams to serve as examples and inspiration for users. These engrams should cover a range of topics and demonstrate different types of relationships within a knowledge graph.

-> Hello Neurons!
	-> Neuron 101 Definitions
	-> Neuron 102: Neurons as functions
	-> Neuron 103: Neuron Composability
-> Hello Engram!
	-> Engram 101: Making your first engram
	-> Engram 102: Coordinating around Engrams
	-> Engram 103: Engram as a product.

5. **Engram Creation Tools**: The kit should provide tools that facilitate the creation of knowledge engrams. This can include software applications, templates, or graphical interfaces that allow users to visually design and structure engrams within a knowledge graph.

6. **Data Integration Resources**: To enrich engrams with diverse and relevant information, the kit should include resources for data integration. This can involve access to public databases, APIs, or guidance on how to connect and incorporate external data sources into a knowledge graph.

7. **Visualization Tools**: The kit should offer visualization tools that help users visualize and explore their knowledge engrams. This can include graph visualization software or libraries that allow users to interactively navigate and analyze engram connections.

8. **Documentation and Tutorials**: The kit should provide detailed documentation and tutorials on best practices for engram design, data integration, and graph visualization. These resources should enable users to gain in-depth knowledge and skills in creating and managing engrams effectively.

## Usage Scenarios
The knowledge engram starter kit can be utilized in various scenarios, including:
- Educational institutions to teach students about knowledge graphs and engram creation.
- Research organizations conducting studies on knowledge representation and graph-based data analysis.
- Individuals interested in creating personal knowledge graphs or building domain-specific engrams.

## Deliverables
The knowledge engram starter kit should deliver the following components:
- Guidebook: Comprehensive documentation on engram creation and management.
- Sample Engrams: A collection of pre-existing engrams showcasing diverse topics and relationships.
- Engram Creation Tools: Software applications or interfaces for designing and structuring engrams.
- Data Integration Resources: Guidelines and resources for integrating external data sources.
- Visualization Tools: Software or libraries for interactive visualization of knowledge engrams.
- Documentation and Tutorials: Detailed instructions and best practices for engram creation and management.

## Conclusion
With this design document, we have outlined the specifications and components necessary to create an optimal knowledge engram starter kit. By providing users with the tools, resources, and guidance needed, we aim to empower individuals and organizations to effectively explore, understand, and create knowledge engrams within the context of knowledge graphs.
