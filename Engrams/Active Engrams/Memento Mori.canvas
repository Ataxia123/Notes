Data Collection: The infrastructure should be able to gather real-time data about the character's death. This could be achieved through integration with the WoW game servers or utilizing game data APIs that provide death event information.\n\n2. Image Generation: A mechanism is needed to generate the snapshot of the character's final battle at the moment of death. This could involve capturing in-game screenshots or utilizing game replay systems to extract frames at the precise moment.\n\n3. Metadata Storage: The metadata related to the character's death, such as their stats and the embedded timestamp, needs to be stored securely. This could be achieved through a database or a decentralized storage system integrated with the blockchain.\n\n4. Blockchain Integration: The infrastructure should interface with a blockchain platform to mint and store the Eternal Moment NFTs. This requires connecting to a suitable blockchain network, implementing smart contracts to handle minting and ownership transfer, and integrating with wallet systems for NFT interactions.\n\n5. Verification and Consensus: To ensure the authenticity and legitimacy of the Eternal Moment NFTs, the infrastructure should incorporate mechanisms for verification and consensus. This could involve utilizing cryptographic hashing to verify the integrity of the captured moment and implementing consensus algorithms to prevent duplicate or fraudulent NFTs.\n\n6. User Interface and NFT Marketplace: A user interface and marketplace should be provided to allow players to view, trade, and showcase their Eternal Moment NFTs. This includes designing a user-friendly interface for NFT interactions, integrating with existing marketplaces, or building a dedicated marketplace platform.\n\n7. Scalability and Performance: The infrastructure should be capable of handling a high volume of Eternal Moment NFT creations, ensuring fast and reliable processing of data, image generation, and blockchain transactions. This may involve utilizing scalable cloud infrastructure, optimizing code performance, and implementing caching mechanisms.\n\n8. Security and Privacy: Robust security measures should be implemented to protect user data, prevent unauthorized access to NFT assets or metadata, and ensure the privacy of sensitive information. This includes encryption, access control mechanisms, and adherence to security best practices.\n\nBy establishing the necessary infrastructure, the project can enable the creation and storage of Eternal Moment NFTs, capturing the poignant moments of a character's demise in the hardcore mode of WoW, and providing an everlasting tribute to their heroic journey.","x":9050,"y":-38,"width":671,"height":1113,"color":"6"},

Create a Deathlog Database: Establish a database to store the deathlog information, including the details of each character's death. Ensure that each entry in the database has a unique identifier associated with it.\n\n2. Build the Merkle Tree: Convert the deathlog database into a Merkle tree structure. Each leaf node of the tree represents an entry in the deathlog database.\n\n3. Generate Merkle Root: Calculate the Merkle root by hashing the leaf nodes of the Merkle tree in a specific order. The Merkle root acts as a summary or fingerprint of the entire tree and ensures data integrity.\n\n4. Link Battle.net Account: Integrate the authentication process with Battle.net to verify the ownership of the player's account. This can be accomplished by using Battle.net's authentication API or implementing OAuth protocols.\n\n5. Wallet Ownership Verification: Once the Battle.net account ownership is verified, establish a connection between the player's wallet and their Battle.net account. This can be achieved by associating wallet addresses with Battle.net account identifiers.\n\n6. Minting Process: Implement a function in the smart contract responsible for minting NFTs. To ensure authorized minting, the player's wallet address and Battle.net account identifier should be cross-verified during the minting process.\n\n7. Ownership Proof: Generate a proof of ownership for the Battle.net account using cryptographic techniques, such as digital signatures. This proof can be stored alongside the Merkle root in the NFT metadata, allowing anyone to independently verify the ownership of the associated Battle.net account.\n\n8. NFT Minting Confirmation: Upon successful ownership verification and integrity checks, mint the NFT with the player's wallet address and include the Merkle root and ownership proof in the NFT metadata.\n\nBy utilizing a Merkle tree to store the deathlog database and implementing ownership verification through Battle.net account association with a wallet, the project can ensure secure and verifiable minting of NFTs, providing players with a unique digital representation of their character's untimely demise in the hardcore mode of WoW.","x":10261,"y":-434,"width":980,"height":1905,"color":"6"},

DevOps and Deployment:\n   - Docker: A containerization platform that provides a consistent environment for running applications across different systems.\n   - Kubernetes: An open-source container orchestration system that automates the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications.\n\nRemember to consider factors such as your team's technical expertise, project requirements, scalability needs, and budget when making technology choices. It's also a good idea to consult with your development team and conduct research to ensure the selected technologies align with your project goals.\n","x":15796,"y":-6030,"width":1900,"height":1221,"color":"6"},
		{"chat_role":"assistant","id":"23ff65ad18a6cf5b","type":"text","text":"In order to implement Blizzard OAuth in your application, you need to follow these steps:\n\n1. **Register your application**:\n   - Go to the Blizzard Developer Portal and sign in.\n   - Click on \"API Access\" in the top menu, then on \"Create a New Application\".\n   - Provide the necessary information. The callback URL should be the URL of your application where Blizzard will redirect users after they authorize your application.\n\n2. **Install the necessary libraries**: Import Blizzard.js and other necessary libraries into your application.\n\n3. **Create an instance of the Blizzard client**:\n   - Initialize a client as shown in the Blizzard.js documentation.\n\n```javascript\nimport { wow } from 'blizzard.js'\n\nconst wowClient = await wow.createInstance({\n  key: BLIZZARD_CLIENT_ID,\n  secret: BLIZZARD_CLIENT_SECRET,\n  origin: 'us', // optional\n  locale: 'en_US', // optional\n  token: '', // optional\n})\n```\n\n4. **Create a login link**: Create a link in your application that redirects to the Blizzard OAuth authorization URL. The URL should look like this `https://:<region>.battle.net/oauth/authorize?client_id=<your_client_id>&redirect_uri=<your_redirect_uri>&response_type=code&scope=<scope>`\n\n5. **Exchange code for an access token**: After the user authorizes your application, Blizzard redirects them to the callback URL you specified, including an authorization code as a query parameter. In your callback route, extract the code and exchange it for an access token by making a POST request to the Blizzard token endpoint.\n\n6. **Use the access token**: Use the returned access token to authorize requests on behalf of the user by including it in the Authorization header in the format `Bearer <token>`.\n\nRemember, OAuth 2.0 is a complex specification. It's crucial to understand its concepts and flows before beginning to implement it. You need to consider how you'll securely store access tokens, the potential use of refresh tokens, and how you'll handle errors or revocation of your application's access by the user.","x":16440,"y":568,"width":1611,"height":1258,"color":"6"},
