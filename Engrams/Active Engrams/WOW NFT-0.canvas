Review the Research Question and understand the key concepts and objectives.\n2. Review the linked Research Links that are provided, focusing particularly on the World of Warcraft Classic Game Data APIs.\n3. Utilize the resources in [[Criptokitties Analysis]] and [[Bored Ape Analysis]] to understand how existing NFT platforms have created unique digital collectibles. \n4. Dig into the [[Data_WoW_Dump]], understand the attributes of characters that are unique to each and the schema used in the game data.\n5. Formulate strategies to map these unique character attributes to create unique, onChain Wow characters.\n6. Document every step of this process, ensuring all findings and insights are detailed in research notes. You may need to create new kNeurons that provide greater specialization in order to complete these tasks.\n7. Actively look for potential challenges, risks, and problems, and document them accordingly. Mishaps aren't failuresâ€”they're opportunities for learning and iterating.\n8. Once the data analysis and mapping process is complete, synthesize your findings, and provide a detailed formal answer to the Research Question.\n9. Prepare a research presentation to present your findings to our team. Use compelling visuals, data displays, and concise language to effectively communicate your results.\n10. Stay ready to adapt and accept new instructions if they are given by the kNeuron supervisor. \n\nRemember, every step of the process is essential. Be thorough, remain curious, and enjoy the process.","x":3420,"y":400,"width":1160,"height":1360,"color":"6"},
