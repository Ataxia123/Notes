The research objective of this project was to understand the uniqueness of Hardcore (HC) World of Warcraft (WoW) characters onChain and explore the relationship between these characters and Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs).

To accomplish these objectives, the following research tasks were carried out:

1. Review research links: The team reviewed the Battle.net Documentation, which provides information on the WoW Classic game data APIs. Additionally, they studied the analysis techniques used for NFTs in projects like Cryptokitties and Bored Ape.

2. Analyze WoW DB sample: The team examined a sample of HC WoW characters to understand their attributes and structure. They focused on identifying key data points such as map ID, map position, class ID, area ID, source ID, and level.

3. Explore GitHub repositories: They looked into the Deathlog repository to understand how WoW character data can be utilized. They also explored the blizzard.js library to explore its capabilities for interacting with WoW.

4. Conduct additional research: The team gathered more information on WoW characters and NFTs using the WoW Data Dump and other relevant sources. They also investigated NFT analysis techniques and methodologies used in other projects.

5. Compile findings and insights: The team documented and analyzed the uniqueness factors of HC WoW characters onChain. They also analyzed the relationship between HC WoW characters and NFTs. Finally, they summarized their key findings and provided recommendations for future research or implementation.

Throughout the research process, the team maintained regular communication with each other and collaborated to ensure a comprehensive and well-informed analysis.

Overall, the research aimed to shed light on the special characteristics of HC WoW characters and explore how they can be connected to the world of NFTs.
