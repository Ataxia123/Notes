Factories of Factories (FoF) can play a critical role in implementing onchain governance by providing a set of practices for developing, deploying, and governing smart contracts or any other deployable components in a blockchain network. Here's how:

1. **Modular and Scalable Architecture**: FoF establishes a modular and scalable architecture, where each Factory contracts serve as templates or models that can be cloned for individual deployments. This architectural approach not only provides modular components but also enables scalability to meet growing needs.

2. **Version Control and Discoverability**: FoF can help manage version control and discoverability. If upgrades to a contract are required, a new version of a Factory can be deployed without interrupting the existing one. This allows for parallel functioning and smooth transitions. 

3. **Security and Efficiency**: By reusing tested and audited code, FoF can create contracts with greater security and efficiency, reducing the risks and development time associated with writing new contracts from scratch. 

4. **Fee-Based Models and Incentives**: Factories can incorporate fee-based business models, allowing developers or stakeholders to earn fees when their contracts are cloned or used. This can provide economic incentives for developers to create high-quality, reusable factories and actively participate in governance.

5. **Decentralized and Autonomous Coordination**: Factories enable seamless onchain coordination by facilitating the creation and management of contracts autonomously. Changes to factories or creation of new ones can be made in line with the governance model established, with voting and consensus mechanisms ensuring a democratic process.

In the broader context of onchain governance, the adoption of a FoF approach can help to ensure that governance activities are decentralized and that all elements of the community are allowed to participate in a structured and efficient way. This promotes a more secure, efficient, transparent, and collaborative development environment ideal for onchain governance.
