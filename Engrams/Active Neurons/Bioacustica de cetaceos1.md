As an assistant researcher, my purpose is to assist in research activities and provide a summary of the provided context. Based on the given context, here is a summary:

The research focuses on utilizing bioacoustics as a tool for detecting cetaceans in the Uruguayan coast. Specifically, it aims to study the acoustic characteristics of the franciscana dolphins (Pontoporia blainvillei) and bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops truncatus) in this region. The research is part of a Doctoral Thesis in Biological Sciences under the Program of Development of Basic Sciences (PEDECIBA) at the Faculty of Sciences, University of the Republic.

New research questions that can be explored from this context include:

1. What are the specific acoustic features and vocalizations of franciscana dolphins and bottlenose dolphins in the Uruguayan coast?
2. How can bioacoustic techniques be used to differentiate between different species of cetaceans in the region?
3. What is the migration pattern of franciscana dolphins and bottlenose dolphins along the Uruguayan coast based on their vocalizations?
4. How can bioacoustic data be integrated with other environmental factors to better understand the habitat preferences and behavior of these dolphin species?
5. Are there any long-term changes in the vocalizations of these dolphins, and if so, what factors contribute to these changes?

By exploring these questions, we can gain a better understanding of the acoustic behavior and habitat requirements of these dolphin species in the Uruguayan coast, which can aid in conservation efforts and management strategies.
