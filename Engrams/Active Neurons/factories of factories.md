Onchain coordination refers to the process of efficiently managing and coordinating activities on the blockchain. The optimal way to coordinate onchain involves utilizing various mechanisms and techniques to ensure effective collaboration and communication among different participants and entities within the blockchain ecosystem.

One important aspect of onchain coordination is the use of factories. Factories are smart contracts that act as repositories for model contracts, allowing others to clone and implement them for specific use-cases. Cloning a contract from a factory enables customization and extension with custom parameters and logic without compromising the core functionality of the contract. Factories provide a faster and safer approach to application development, as developers can focus on building code on top of the cloned contract instead of starting from scratch.

The benefits of using factories in onchain coordination are numerous. Factories allow for easy cloning of existing contracts that have been tested and used by many users, thus increasing security and reliability. Additionally, the factory approach promotes the creation of a shared codebase with common standards, making integration and collaboration between developers easier. The Factory-of-Factories (FoF) acts as a deployer and aggregator of factories, enabling developers to deploy multiple factories, ensure versioning, discoverability, and modularity.

Customization is a key aspect of onchain coordination with factories. Developers can extend the functionality of cloned contracts using extension smart contracts, tailoring them to their specific project needs. This ensures that the cloned contract remains secure while allowing for integration and interaction with other contracts and systems.

Factories also provide opportunities for implementing business models within the blockchain ecosystem. With the factory approach, developers can earn fees when their contracts are cloned or used. These fee-based business models can be based on creation fees, where users pay a certain amount of tokens to clone the contract, or usage fees, where users pay fees for the use of the cloned contract, either as a fixed amount or a percentage of the transaction value.

In summary, onchain coordination relies on the efficient use of factories, providing a secure and customizable approach to smart contract development. Factories enable the cloning and customization of contracts, fostering a shared codebase and facilitating collaboration among developers. The Factory-of-Factories (FoF) acts as an orchestrator, ensuring versioning, discoverability, and modularity. Moreover, factories can incorporate fee-based business models, allowing developers to earn fees when their contracts are cloned or used. Overall, onchain coordination with factories promotes secure, efficient, and collaborative development on the blockchain.
