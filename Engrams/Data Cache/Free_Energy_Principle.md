The Free Energy Principle is a unified brain theory proposed by Karl Friston. The key points of this principle are:

1. Adaptive agents must minimize the long-term average of surprise associated with sensory exchanges with the world to maintain a limited repertoire of states and resist a natural tendency to disorder.

2. Surprise is based on predictions about sensations, which depend on an internal generative model of the world. Agents minimize free energy by changing their predictions (perception) or by changing the predicted sensory inputs (action).

3. Perception optimizes predictions by minimizing free energy with respect to synaptic activity, efficacy, and gain. This provides Bayes-optimal representations of what caused sensations.

4. Bayes-optimal perception is mathematically equivalent to predictive coding and maximizing the mutual information between sensations and their causes.

5. Learning under the free-energy principle can be formulated in terms of optimizing the connection strengths in hierarchical models of the sensorium.

6. Action under the free-energy principle reduces to suppressing sensory prediction
