The categorization of kNeurons (knowledge neurons) on whether they increase or decrease coherence in a knowledge graph system presents a novel and complex topic in the field of computational knowledge graph construction.

Currently, research primarily focuses on the role of neurons in neural networks rather than their effect on coherence in knowledge graphs. Nonetheless, it is plausible that certain patterns or types of kNeurons might enhance or reduce coherence using predefined rules or learning models, possibly by adjusting the way entities and relationships are represented or linked within the graph.

However, detailed insights would be dependent on specific parameters of the kNeurons and the knowledge graph. Factors such as the implementation of the knowledge graph, the specific functionality of the kNeurons, and the nature of the data represented could greatly influence outcomes.

Highlighting relevant research:
"Understanding the Role of Individual Units in a Deep Neural Network" - This study gives a helpful overview of how to understand the functionality of individual neurons in a neural network.

"Neural-symbolic computing: An effective methodology for principled integration of machine learning and reasoning" - This paper talks about neural-symbolic computing, that falls in the intersection of neural networks and knowledge graphs, and might provide relevant insights.

Please note, that parameters, methodologies, and evaluation criteria used in these resources may differ from those required in the requested analysis. Therefore, tailored research and specific methodologies might be necessary to categorize kNeurons based on their impact on coherence. 

Although the description above focuses on kNeurons within a knowledge graph system, a similar approach could potentially be applied to different types of knowledge representation systems, such as ontologies or other types of semantic networks. It is a rich field for future research.
