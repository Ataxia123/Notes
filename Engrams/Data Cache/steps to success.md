1. Install development environment: If it is not already in place, you will need first to set up the development environment. This includes downloading and installing compatible versions of Node.js and npm. You could use nvm for managing multiple node versions on your system.

2. Familiarize yourself with Obsidian API and plugin setup: Before writing the plugin itself, you should understand the structure of an Obsidian plugin and how to initialize a new plugin. The [Obsidian API documentation](https://github.com/obsidianmd/obsidian-api) and [sample plugin repo](https://github.com/obsidianmd/obsidian-sample-plugin) are good places to start.

3. Initialize a new Obsidian plugin: Utilize the sample plugin as a template to initialize a basic Obsidian plugin that loads and unloads correctly without any added functionality yet.

4. Define a basic layout for your frontend: Before connecting the frontend to MetaMask, design how you would like the end product to look like and start building towards that.

5. Familiarize yourself with MetaMask's API: Next, familiarize yourself with MetaMask's API from their [official documentation](https://docs.metamask.io/guide/).

6. Incorporate MetaMask Initialization in the plugin: Once you have defined the initial structure of your plugin, start incorporating the MetaMask functionality. Your plugin should be able to initialize MetaMask when it loads.

7. Add account connection functionality: Add functionality to your plugin that will allow the user to connect to their MetaMask account.

8. Define your plugin's functionality: Once the user has connected their MetaMask account, they should be able to interact with it through your plugin. Add interface options and User Interface handlers that allow for this interaction.

9. Test and iterate: All along the process of your plugin creation, you should be testing each piece of functionality to ensure it is working as expected. This will likely involve lots of iterations on your codebase.

10. Publish your plugin: Once you are satisfied with your plugin's functionality and have tested it thoroughly, you can consider publishing it so other Obsidian users can use it.

Remember, since Obsidian does not run in a web browser environment, MetaMask integration may be restrained due to functionalities such as popups that MetaMask provides when it is installed as a browser extension. Extra measures might need to be taken to either handle the popups in Obsidian or circumvent them.
