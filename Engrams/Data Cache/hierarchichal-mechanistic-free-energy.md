The hierarchically mechanistic mind. (**A**) Schematic of the multiscale hierarchical organisation of brain networks. Neural networks are composed of nodes and their connections, called edges. A node, defined as an interacting unit of a network, is itself a network composed of smaller nodes interacting at a lower hierarchical level, producing nested neural networks that extend from neurons, to macrocolumns, and to macroscopic brain regions. From [[72]](#br0720). (**B**) A simple cortical hierarchy with ascending prediction errors and descending predictions. Superficial pyramidal cells (red triangles) compare expectations (at each level) with top-down predictions from deep pyramidal cells (black triangles) at higher levels. Neuromodulatory gating or gain control (blue) of superficial pyramidal cells determines their relative influence on the deep pyramidal cells that encode expectations by modulating their precision. From [[93]](#br0930). (**C**): The variational neuroethology of human cognition and biobehaviour. F(s˜(a),μ(i)|m(i)) represents the free-energy of the sensory data (over time), s˜(a), and the states _μ_ of an agent _m_(_i_) ∈ _s_ that belongs to a subgroup _s_ ∈ _c_ of class _c_. Action (_a_) governs the sampling of sensory data, and the physical states of the phenotype (_μ_) encode beliefs or expectations (and expectations of the mean of a probability distribution). Free energy minimisation dynamics vary across timescales, ranging from neurocognition in real-time (i.e., perception and action; learning and attention); neurodevelopment throughout the lifespan; epigenetic mechanisms that minimise free energy across generations (e.g., kin); and the process of adaptation, which involves the optimisation of human generative models over time and conspecifics via the inheritance of adaptive priors [[104]](#br1040). These temporal processes are captured by Tinbergen's four levels of inquiry, which appeal to a dynamic causal hierarchy that is encapsulated by complementary paradigms in psychology: evolutionary psychology; evolutionary developmental approaches; developmental psychology; and the psychological subdisciplines [[7]](#br0070), [[70]](#br0700).

Following EST, the hierarchical brain also exemplifies the complementary relationship between evolution and development—selection has canalized early sensorimotor regions that serve as neurodevelopmental anchors, allowing for the protracted, activity-dependent self-organisation of ‘domain-general’ association cortices throughout development that enhance evolvability by responding flexibly to environmental change [[75]](#br0750), [[76]](#br0760). Consistent with this, simulation studies of evolving networks have shown that a hierarchical neural structure enhances evolvability by adapting faster to new environments than non-hierarchical structures [[77]](#br0770). The hierarchical segregation of neural networks into distributed neighbourhoods has also been found to stretch the parameter range for self-organized criticality by allowing subcritical and supercritical dynamics to co-exist simultaneously [[78]](#br0780), which optimizes information processing and is therefore likely to be favoured by selection [[79]](#br0790). Maturational studies of neural networks throughout childhood and adolescence have further revealed that human cortical development mirrors phylogeny, progressing from the sensorimotor hierarchies found in all mammals through to recent association areas shared by humans and other primates [[80]](#br0800). The phylogeny of the brain is also reflected across nested levels of neurophysiological organisation, ranging from genes and transcription factors through to synaptic epigenesis and the long-range connectivity that is thought to underpin consciousness [[81]](#br0810). It is unsurprising, then, that a hierarchical neural structure has been found in every mammal examined to date [[82]](#br0820).

The HMM rests on two assumptions. First, it subsumes the FEP as a biologically plausible EST of the evolution, development, form, and function of the brain. The FEP suggests that instead of just encoding a model of the world, the brain itself manifests a (hierarchical) phenotypic transcription of causal structure in its environment (i.e., an embodied statistical or generative model) that is optimized by evolution, development, and learning. Here, selection is simply nature's way of performing Bayesian model optimisation by minimising the (variational) free energy of human phenotypes across different (Tinbergian) timescales ([Fig. 4](/pmc/articles/PMC5857288/figure/fg0040/), panel C). Emphasis is placed on adaptive priors, which are (epi)genetically-specified expectations that have been shaped by selection to guide action-perception cycles toward adaptive or unsurprising states [[26]](#br0260).

The second assumption follows EST in psychology by recognising that the brain is an emergent sub-system produced by a hierarchy of causal mechanisms that act on the brain-body-environment system over time (i.e., adaptation, phylogeny, ontogeny, and mechanism; [[7]](#br0070), [[53]](#br0530), [[83]](#br0830)). This causal hierarchy is recapitulated by major paradigms in psychology—which focus differentially on Tinbergen's [[69]](#br0690) four questions ([Fig. 4](/pmc/articles/PMC5857288/figure/fg0040/), panel C)—and calls for sophisticated, multiscale hypotheses that synthesise the FEP with different research programs in psychology and anthropology to explain both why a particular trait is adaptive, along with how it emerges from intergenerational, developmental, and real-time processes [[7]](#br0070), [[70]](#br0700). The FEP and EST in psychology can therefore be regarded as different sides of the same coin—the FEP supplies a fully generalizable mechanistic theory of neural structure and function that applies to species generally, while an evolutionary systems approach to psychology builds upon the FEP by providing a substantive, evolutionary framework that is capable of explaining how the FEP manifests in Homo sapiens [[84]](#br0840).
