## The Emergence of Knowledge Graphs
 A Fresh Take on the Scientific Method Hyperstructure

In the world of Big Data, Knowledge Graphs are making waves with their ability to store, interlink, and present data in an intuitive, structured manner. They are databases that draw on graph-structured models to encapsulate the semantics of entities - events, objects, concepts, and situations.

Beholding the characteristics of hyperstructures, Knowledge Graphs act as persistent, free, and valuable storehouses of relationships and insights aggregated over time. They endorse an open and contributory culture, facilitating anyone to add or retrieve information. Knowledge Graphs encompass the provision for growth and progression, welcoming new data points and associations across myriad topics.

The neutrality of these Knowledge Graphs is visible in their objective portrayal of the connections between data, making them user-agnostic. Moreover, the information added to these graphs is beneficial to all users, echoing the ethos of a positive-sum environment inherent in the scientific method.
