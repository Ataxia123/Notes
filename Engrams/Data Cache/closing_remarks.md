## 5. Concluding remarks

The purpose of this article was to answer Schrödinger's question – ‘what is life?’ – by presenting a hierarchical multiscale free energy formulation—called variational neuroethology—that offers the sciences of life, mind, behaviour and society with a principled, computationally tractable guide to discovery. Arguably, the FEP affords a unifying perspective that explains the dynamics of living systems across spatial and temporal scales. The ontology for biological systems discussed here entails a multidimensional phase space populated by events (i.e., living systems as adaptive, self-organising patterns) that depend on the temporal dynamics of free energy minimisation. These events can be described as spatially and temporally nested Markov blankets, the dynamics of which are summarised by the Lagrangian of the FEP. Synthesising this framework with Tinbergen's four questions allows us to frame our scientific investigations with clearly defined temporal and spatial bounds, depending on the specific questions we wish to answer. We have described an empirically supported exemplar of this approach in the cognitive and behavioural sciences—the HMM—and shown how this theory yields unique and promising avenues for interdisciplinary research. The challenge, of course, lies in translating theory into productive scientific practice, and in testing the current limits of the FEP by applying it to species without a brain, like E. coli, fungi and flora.
