## 1. Introduction

As Schrödinger [[1]](#br0010) famously observed many years ago, living systems are unique among natural systems because they appear to resist the second law of thermodynamics by persisting as bounded, self-organizing systems over time. How is this remarkable feat possible? What is life? How is it realised in physical systems? And how can we explain and predict its various manifestations and behaviours? By asking such questions, Schrödinger inspired a new line of inquiry that broadly centres on evolutionary systems theory (EST), which has become one of the most pervasive paradigms in modern science. Closely related to complexity science, EST is an interdisciplinary field that builds on the pioneering efforts of theorists like Fisher, Wright, Haldane and Prigogine [[2]](#br0020), [[3]](#br0030), [[4]](#br0040), [[5]](#br0050), and has found expression in influential models such as Eigen and Schuster's hypercycles [[6]](#br0060). Put simply, EST explains dynamic, evolving systems in terms of the reciprocal relationship between general selection and self-organisation [[7]](#br0070), [[8]](#br0080), [[9]](#br0090).

Originating from biology, general selection entails three interacting principles of change: variation, selection, and retention [[10]](#br0100). This Darwinian process not only applies to organisms (i.e., natural selection), but acts on all dynamically coupled systems (e.g., molecules, neural synapses, behaviours, theories, and technologies; [[11]](#br0110), [[12]](#br0120), [[13]](#br0130)), and is a universal principle that cuts across both statistical and quantum mechanics [[14]](#br0140), [[15]](#br0150). On the other hand, self-organisation stems from dynamic systems theory in physics [[16]](#br0160), [[17]](#br0170), [[18]](#br0180), and refers to the emergence of functional, higher-order patterns resulting from recursive interactions among the simpler components of coupled dynamical systems over time (see Box 1). To date, research in EST has focused on complex adaptive systems—such as the brain [[19]](#br0190), [[20]](#br0200), social systems [[21]](#br0210), and the biosphere [[22]](#br0220)—which adapt to the environment through an autonomous process of selection that recruits the outcomes of locally interacting components—within that system—to select a subset for replication or enhancement [[23]](#br0230).

At the turn of the millennium, the principles of EST inspired a new theory in neuroscience called the free-energy principle (FEP). Drawn chiefly from statistical thermodynamics and machine learning, the FEP is a formal model of neuronal processes that was initially proposed to explain perception, learning and action [[24]](#br0240), [[25]](#br1110), but has since been extended to explain the evolution, development, form, and function of the brain [[26]](#br0260). More recently, it has also been applied to biological systems across spatial and temporal scales, ranging from phenomena at the micro-scale (e.g., dendritic self-organisation and morphogenesis; [[27]](#br0270), [[28]](#br0280)), across intermediate scales (e.g., cultural ensembles; [[29]](#br0290)), and at the macro-scale (e.g., natural selection; [[30]](#br0300)). We believe that this theory puts us in a strong position to answer Schrödinger's question, and at the same time, shed new light on the mind, body, behaviour, and society.

We begin by describing how the FEP offers a plausible, mechanistic EST that applies to living systems in general. We then combine this variational principle with Tinbergen's four research questions in biology to describe a new scientific ontology—called variational neuroethology—that can be used to develop mathematically tractable, substantive explanations of living organisms. We conclude by applying this meta-theory to the most complex living system known to date—namely, ourselves—before translating this framework into a systematic research heuristic. In doing so, we hope to highlight a plausible, computationally tractable guide to discovery in the biological, cognitive and social sciences.
