The last two years of ~~Twitter~~ X have been tumultuous, to say the least. After the platform was ~~[bought](https://www.reuters.com/technology/exclusive-twitter-set-accept-musks-best-final-offer-sources-2022-04-25/)~~ ~~[not bought](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/06/technology/elon-musk-twitter.html)~~ [bought](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/27/technology/elon-musk-twitter-deal-complete.html) by Elon Musk for $44 billion last year, Elon enacted sweeping changes to the company's [staffing](https://www.euronews.com/next/2022/11/04/twitter-temporarily-closes-offices-as-elon-musk-begins-mass-layoffs), [content moderation](https://www.npr.org/2022/11/29/1139822833/twitter-covid-misinformation-policy-not-enforced) and [business model](https://www.npr.org/2022/12/12/1139619598/twitter-blue-relaunch), not to mention changes to the culture on the site that may well have been a result of Elon's soft power more than any specific policy decision. But in the middle of these highly contentious actions, one new feature on Twitter grew rapidly in importance, and seems to be beloved by people across the political spectrum: Community Notes.

Community Notes is a fact-checking tool that sometimes attaches context notes, like the one on Elon's tweet above, to tweets as a fact-checking and anti-misinformation tool. It was originally called Birdwatch, and was first rolled out as a pilot project in January 2021. Since then, it has expanded in stages, with the most rapid phase of its expansion coinciding with Twitter's takeover by Elon last year. Today, Community Notes appear frequently on tweets that get a very large audience on Twitter, including those on contentious political topics. And both in my view, and in the view of many people across the political spectrum I talk to, the notes, when they appear, are informative and valuable.

But what interests me most about Community Notes is how, despite not being a "crypto project", it might be the closest thing to an instantiation of "crypto values" that we have seen in the mainstream world. Community Notes are not written or curated by some centrally selected set of experts; rather, they can be written and voted on by anyone, and which notes are shown or not shown is decided entirely by an [open source](https://github.com/twitter/communitynotes) algorithm. The Twitter site has a [detailed and extensive guide](https://communitynotes.twitter.com/guide/en/about/introduction) describing how the algorithm works, and you can [download the data](https://communitynotes.twitter.com/guide/en/under-the-hood/download-data) containing which notes and votes have been published, run [the algorithm](https://github.com/twitter/communitynotes/tree/main/sourcecode) locally, and verify that the output matches what is visible on the Twitter site. It's not perfect, but it's surprisingly close to satisfying the ideal of [credible neutrality](https://nakamoto.com/credible-neutrality/), all while being impressively useful, even under contentious conditions, at the same time.
