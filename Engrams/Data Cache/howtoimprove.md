### Is Community Notes not "brave" enough?

The main criticism of Community Notes that I have seen is basically that it does not do enough. [Two](https://www.poynter.org/fact-checking/2023/why-twitters-community-notes-feature-mostly-fails-to-combat-misinformation/) recent [articles](https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2022-twitter-birdwatch-community-notes-misinformation-politics/#xj4y7vzkg) that I have seen make this point. Quoting one:

> The program is severely hampered by the fact that for a Community Note to be public, it has to be generally accepted by a consensus of people from all across the political spectrum.
> 
> "It has to have ideological consensus," he said. "That means people on the left and people on the right have to agree that that note must be appended to that tweet."
> 
> Essentially, it requires a "cross-ideological agreement on truth, and in an increasingly partisan environment, achieving that consensus is almost impossible, he said.

This is a difficult issue, but ultimately I come down on the side that it is better to let ten misinformative tweets go free than it is to have one tweet covered by a note that judges it unfairly. We have seen years of fact-checking that _is_ brave, and _does_ come from the perspective of "well, actually we know the truth, and we know that one side lies much more often than the other". And what happened as a result?

Honestly, some pretty widespread distrust of fact-checking as a concept. One strategy here is to say: ignore the haters, remember that the fact checking experts really do know the facts better than any voting system, and stay the course. But going all-in on this approach [seems risky](https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/02/23/in-favor-of-niceness-community-and-civilization/). There is value in building cross-tribal institutions that are at least somewhat respected by everyone. As with [William Blackstone's dictum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackstone%27s_ratio) and the courts, it feels to me that maintaining such respect requires a system that commits far more sins of [omission](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sin_of_omission) than it does sins of commission. And so it seems valuable to me that there is at least one major organization that is taking this alternate path, and treating its rare cross-tribal respect as a resource to be cherished and built upon.

Another reason why I think it is okay for Community Notes to be conservative is that I do not think it is the goal for every misinformative tweet, or even most misinformative tweets, to receive a corrective note. **Even if less than one percent of misinformative tweets get a note providing context or correcting them, Community Notes is still providing an exceedingly valuable service as an educational tool.** The goal is not to correct everything; rather, the goal is to remind people that multiple perspectives exist, that certain kinds of posts that look convincing and engaging in isolation are actually quite incorrect, and you, yes you, can often go do a basic internet search to verify that it's incorrect.

Community Notes cannot be, and is not meant to be, a miracle cure that solves all problems in public epistemology. Whatever problems it does not solve, there is plenty of room for other mechanisms, whether newfangled gadgets such as [prediction](https://manifold.markets/) [markets](https://manifold.markets/) or good old-fashioned organizations hiring full-time staff with domain expertise, to try to fill in the gaps.
