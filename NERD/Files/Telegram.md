I had an idea for a funding model, initially considering suggesting it for ETHos. However, I now believe it would be better as a separate project. The model aims to streamline project funding, addressing common challenges faced in the process.

Typically, when a project needs funding, they raise funds through a presale, but two common issues arise:

Inefficiency of Keeping Presale ETH: After the presale, some ETH remains idle in the team's wallet until they need to spend it.

Inflation Risk with Token Sales: Alternatively, some projects keep tokens in a team wallet and sell them when they need funds. However, this can lead to inflation as more tokens enter the market.

To overcome these challenges, my funding model introduces the concept of the PHOENIX LP. It provides a straightforward solution by allowing the presale ETH to be immediately utilized from day one in a liquidity pool (LP), generating returns right away.

Moreover, the model ensures the project has a steady stream of income without causing inflation, as the tokens are not sold directly.

By developing this funding model as a separate project, we could secure our own funding first and then apply it to other projects. In future iterations, I intend to explore additional enhancements, such as enabling airdrops with no risk of causing a price crash. This would enable a fair distribution of tokens without adversely affecting their value.

Through this innovative approach, the funding model aims to offer projects a more efficient, sustainable, and fair method for funding their development and growth.

ðŸ‘† I used chat GPT to write that because I was struggling to make it coherent ðŸ™ƒ

So in practice a team would take all of their LP tokens and lock them in the vault... They would set some parameters in the 'pull and burn' contract

- withdrawal period (eg once a week)
- half life (eg 52 weeks)
- max sell % (eg 50%)

And then once a week they would be able to get some of their funding out of the liquidity pool

The amount of LP tokens that get withdrawn week to week would infonatly regress such that it halves every 52 weeks, and the total never exceeds 50% ( I've figured out the maths for that already)

This would be great for projects that do fair launches... They wouldn't need to hold team tokens and because of how this system could work wouldn't cause any inflation

Ok so all this chat is going to go on the brain
