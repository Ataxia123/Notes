>[!cue] Academia


[[Letter from At0x | Academia]] is perhaps the very thing that sets apart the human race from other species. It is only because we question our surroundings that we have been able to extract meaning from reality and use that meaning to bend our environment to our will. 

However, Academia should be seen as an emergent property. This suggests that its not inherent of the human existence, but rather, it is a product of the quality of our institutions and societal structures. Therefore, the role of #DeSci in general is creating these institutions which are designed to foster an environment conducive to academic growth and knowledge generation.


>[!cue] [[SM_Wikipedia | The Scientific Method]]


 The scientific method formalizes a framework of recursive thought processes that lead to knowledge generation.  It's the systematic approach to questioning, investigating, and understanding our surroundings that forms the basis of scientific research.

 despite being described using many technical terms, Al the Scientific Method really is at its core is a structured way to explain the thought process. It provides a systematic approach to understanding phenomena or answering questions, but at its core, it's about observing, questioning, hypothesizing, experimenting, analyzing, and concluding. It's a way to organize thoughts and approach problems in a logical, methodical way.

>[!cue] Sharing is caring


Sharing thoughts using the scientific method offers numerous benefits. It allows for the systematic and logical breakdown of ideas, making them easier to understand and analyze. This structured approach to thought sharing promotes clarity, reduces misunderstanding, and facilitates meaningful discussion.

The value of collective thought creation is immense. Collective thought creation is a process where multiple minds contribute their unique perspectives. This enriches the overall understanding of a subject. When multiple minds come together, each bringing their unique perspectives and insights, the result is a richer and more comprehensive understanding of the subject at hand than what any of the individuals could have produced by themselves. Collective thought creation fosters innovation, as ideas are shared, challenged, refined, and built upon. It also promotes inclusivity, as it values and incorporates diverse viewpoints.

>[!cue] Proof of Thought


>The concept of "proof of thought" suggests that thoughts and ideas can be validated and recorded. This creates a transparent record of intellectual contribution, enhancing trust and accountability.

The [[IoK|institution of knowledge]] refers to the systems that facilitate the creation and dissemination of knowledge. Implementing the scientific method within these institutions can enhance their effectiveness and credibility.

>[!summary] In a Nutshell
> - Academia isnt an intrinsic property of the human condition but rather an emergent property depends on the quality of the institutions and society at large 
>- The scientific formalizes a framework of recursive thought processes that lead to knowledge generation.
>- However academia is also currently not matching the speed of knowledge creation. 
>- New more dynamic, distributed and decentralized systems can be created using newly available techniches such as LMM structuring of data and community wide context creation
 
## Further topics:

3. **OnChain Science**: This is a revolutionary approach to academia that leverages blockchain technology to create a more dynamic, distributed, and decentralized system for knowledge creation and dissemination. It uses techniques such as LMM structuring of data and community-wide context creation to address the challenges of traditional academia, particularly its inability to keep pace with rapid knowledge creation.

4. **NerdBrain Project**: This project is pioneering new research standards using blockchain technology. It outlines a research process based on the principles of Submission, Assessment, Funding, Execution, Executable Result, and Loop (SAFER-Loop). This process is managed by a Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO), which creates an on-chain data structure for project repositories and research proposals.

5. **Importance of Software in Research**: The NerdBrain project emphasizes the need for secure and replicable software in digital research processes. It uses Obsidian and its plugins to ensure that all software used in the research process adheres to these standards.

6. **5 R Principle**: This principle, adopted by the NerdBrain project, ensures the quality and usefulness of content added to the repository. It stands for relevance, rapid and recursive application, redefining rigor, reporting on resources required, and replicability.

7. **Application in Knowledge Engineering and Superconductors**: The principles and methodologies of OnChain Science and NerdBrain Research Standards can be applied to accelerate research and development in various fields, including Knowledge Engineering and Superconductors. By leveraging blockchain technology, these approaches can create a more efficient, transparent, and collaborative environment for scientific research, potentially leading to groundbreaking advancements.
