Course Title: Nerd Tools and Software Architecture

Course Description:
The "Nerd Tools and Software Architecture" course is designed to equip students with essential technical skills and knowledge required by modern software developers. Students will learn the fundamentals of Git and version control, as well as gain insights into software architecture, including frontend, backend, and blockend (blockchain-based applications) development concepts. Through a combination of theoretical lessons and practical exercises, students will be prepared to build robust and efficient software solutions.

Course Objectives:
1. Understand the significance of version control and its role in collaborative development.
2. Master the essential concepts of software architecture and its components.
3. Gain proficiency in frontend development principles and technologies.
4. Learn backend development concepts and frameworks.
5. Explore the unique challenges and opportunities presented by blockend development.

Suggested Course Duration: 8 weeks (16 sessions)
