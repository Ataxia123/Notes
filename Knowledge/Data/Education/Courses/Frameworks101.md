Course Title: Introduction to Frameworks and Infrastructure Solutions

Course Description:
The "Introduction to Frameworks and Infrastructure Solutions" course is designed to familiarize students with modern web development frameworks and infrastructure tools. Students will gain hands-on experience with TypeScript-based frontend frameworks (React, Vue, Svelte) and the Node.js backend framework. Additionally, the course will explore various infrastructure solutions for web hosting and data storage, including both centralized and decentralized options.

Course Objectives:
1. Introduce students to TypeScript-based frontend and backend frameworks.
2. Provide practical experience in building web applications using popular frontend frameworks.
3. Familiarize students with the Node.js backend framework and backend development concepts.
4. Explore different web hosting and data storage solutions, including decentralized options.
