# Nerd Syllabus


Welcome to our collaborative learning environment! We're a group of passionate learners and developers, or as we like to call ourselves, "nerds", working together to understand and advance in the world of software development and blockchain technology.

Our current focus is on open-source collaboration. We believe in the power of collective knowledge and aim to create a framework that encourages and facilitates this. We're reaching out to key contributors, understanding their projects, and identifying areas where they can use support. We're also working on developing a comprehensive understanding of the tools and technologies used in open-source software development.

We offer courses like "Nerd Tools and Software Architecture", "Introduction to Frameworks and Infrastructure Solutions", and "Introduction to Blockchain and Cryptocurrencies". These courses are designed to equip you with essential technical skills and knowledge required by modern software developers. You'll learn about Git and version control, software architecture, frontend and backend development, blockchain technology, and more.

We also have a unique approach to learning. We organize activities like discussion panels, lectures with experts, coding tutorials, blog posts, and explainers to assist your learning experience. We collaborate in a virtual environment called Gather, which we refer to as our little corner of the metaverse.

To keep our learning and projects organized, we use a day planner. This helps us set daily goals, divide our day into time blocks dedicated to specific tasks, allocate time for collaboration, and include necessary breaks. At the end of the day, we review our progress and jot down important points in a notes section.

We're excited to have you join us on this journey of learning and development. Let's explore the world of software development and blockchain technology together!
