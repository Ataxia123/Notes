### About Solana (SOL)

Solana is a Layer 1 blockchain that offers users fast speeds and affordable costs. It supports [smart contracts](https://www.coingecko.com/learn/crypto-smart-contracts) and facilitates the creation of decentralized applications (dApps). Projects built on Solana include a variety of DeFi platforms as well as NFT marketplaces, where users can buy [Solana-based NFT projects](https://www.coingecko.com/learn/solana-nft). Its high performance means Solana doesn’t require a traditional scaling [Layer 2](https://www.coingecko.com/learn/what-are-layer-2-crypto-protocols) solution; instead, Layer 2s on Solana focus on interoperability and connecting Solana to other chains. 

To solve the blockchain trilemma, where developers have to balance decentralization, security and scalability when building blockchains, Solana combines the Proof-of-History (PoH) consensus mechanism alongside the more common [Proof-of-Stake](https://www.coingecko.com/en/glossary/proof-of-stake-pos). This lets Solana achieve consensus more quickly by reducing the workload.

Proof-of-History is a time-based consensus mechanism that develops a historical record of an activity based on its position in the [blockchain](https://www.coingecko.com/learn/what-is-a-blockchain), which is represented by a hash tree. This lets any node quickly verify the order of all transactions by checking the hashes on the hash tree, allowing for fast and efficient validation without requiring the nodes to store the full history of every transaction.

### What’s Next for Solana?

Solana is introducing a new validator client, which significantly reduces the likelihood of any bug bringing down the Solana network. Also, Solana boasts a range of mainstream companies supporting the Solana ecosystem, ranging from Google to Stripe and Discord. Solana is also focusing on making mobile friendlier to dApps, announcing the Solana Mobile Stack and the Solana Mobile flagship device Saga, that promises a near-hardware wallet level of security to mobile devices. 

### What Can SOL Be Used For?

On the Solana network, SOL can be used for staking to help secure the network. Users can either stake their SOL directly, or delegate their holdings to an active validator in exchange for a share of the rewards. Also, as SOL is the native token of the Solana blockchain, [gas fees](https://www.coingecko.com/en/glossary/gas) for sending transactions or interacting with smart contracts are charged in SOL. Beyond the above utility for SOL, it can also be traded on exchanges, put up as collateral for crypto loans, or providing liquidity in [liquidity pools](https://www.coingecko.com/learn/what-is-a-decentralized-crypto-exchange-dex).
