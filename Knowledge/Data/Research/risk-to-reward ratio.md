Summary: 

Position Size = (Account Risk / (R * Stop Loss))

Here are a few examples of how you can calculate position sizing when you are only willing to take on a trade that has a minimum of 5R return:

Example 1:
Account Risk: $1000
R: 5
Stop Loss: $50

Position Size = (1000 / (5 * 50))
Position Size = 4

In this example, if you are willing to risk $1000 and your stop loss is set at $50, you can take a position size of 4 contracts or shares or tokens.

Example 2:
Account Risk: $5000
R: 5
Stop Loss: $100

Position Size = (5000 / (5 * 100))
Position Size = 10

In this example, if you are willing to risk $5000 and your stop loss is set at $100, you can take a position size of 10 contracts or shares or tokens.

Example 3:
Account Risk: $2000
R: 5
Stop Loss: $25

Position Size = (2000 / (5 * 25))
Position Size = 16

In this example, if you are willing to risk $2000 and your stop loss is set at $25, you can take a position size of 16 contracts or shares or tokens.

Remember, these examples are just calculations based on the given formula. It's important to consider other factors such as market conditions, volatility, and your own risk tolerance before determining the appropriate position size for a trade.
