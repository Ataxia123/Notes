The concept of "R" in risk management when putting on a trade refers to the [[risk-to-reward ratio]]. It is a way to quantify the potential profit or loss of a trade relative to the amount of risk taken. The "R" represents a unit of risk, typically expressed as a multiple of the initial risk or the amount of money a trader is willing to risk on a trade.

For example, if a trader sets a stop-loss level at $100 and expects a potential profit of $300, the risk-to-reward ratio would be 1:3. In this case, the trader is willing to risk $100 (1R) to potentially gain $300 (3R).

By considering the risk-to-reward ratio, traders can assess whether a trade is worth taking based on the potential reward relative to the risk involved. It helps in determining the appropriate position size and setting stop-loss levels to manage risk effectively. Traders often aim for a favorable risk-to-reward ratio to ensure that potential profits outweigh potential losses in the long run.
