# Current State of Affairs

Based on your notes, the research on superconductors so far can be summarized as follows:

1. The focus is on one-dimensional superconductors due to their potential for higher efficiency.
2. The creation of superconductors involves complex chemical reactions and precise conditions, with ongoing research to refine and improve the process.
3. The superconductor LK-99®, a modified-lead apatite crystal structure, exhibits superconductivity at room temperature and atmospheric pressure.
4. The superconducting properties of LK-99® are attributed to volume contraction resulting from an insulator-metal transition achieved by substituting Pb with Cu, and on-site repulsive Coulomb interaction enhanced by structural deformation.
5. The superconducting critical temperature, Tc, of the LK-99® sample is above 126.85℃ (400K).
6. The properties of Cu-substituted lead phosphate apatite have been further investigated, identifying correlated isolated flat bands at the Fermi level, a common signature of high transition temperatures in established superconductors.
7. These isolated bands arise from a structural distortion induced by the Cu ions and a chiral charge density wave from the Pb lone pairs.
8. A minimal two-band model has been proposed to explain the low-energy physics in this system.

Topics to expand upon include:

1. The differences between one-dimensional and three-dimensional superconductors.
2. The specific chemical reactions and conditions involved in creating superconductors.
3. The process of refining and improving the creation of superconductors.
4. The properties and potential applications of LK-99®.
5. The role of Cu substitution in the lead phosphate apatite structure.
6. The significance of isolated flat bands at the Fermi level in superconductors.
7. The structural distortion induced by the Cu ions and the role of Pb's lone pairs.
8. The minimal two-band model and its implications for understanding superconductivity.

# Timeline 

⏰Previously, on Friday 28 July
Kwon goes rogue and presents at the MMC conference.
Lee is forced to give an interview to Yonhap, retracting the 3 author paper, and disclosing Kwon had been fired 4 months earlier.

⏰Continuing:
🇺🇸 Virginia:, HT Kim, shrugs off the frenzy, corrects the 6 author Arxiv paper. He resubmits on Saturday, with the correction to be mailed out by Arxiv on Tuesday morning. He then starts on his calls and emails.

🇺🇸 Illinois: At DoE funded, Argonne National Labs, Jorg Maser at the Center for Nanoscale Materials gets a call from HT. Maser is trying to figure out what is happening in LK99 as its superconductivity fades around the critical temperature. HT and Maser brainstorm before dialing off.

🇰🇷 Seoul: JH Kim is in the salt mines, supervising production of more LK99, trying to scale up the manufacturing process. HT has more questions on the manufacturing process, which JH quickly answers. Later in the day Lee storms in to the office, swearing at JH’s LinkedIn shitposts. JH deletes everything on his LinkedIn, killing the last Western social media presence of any member of the core team. On Saturday, an Internet influencer from China makes a visit to the modest Qcenter headquarters, is told “Yes, yes we have it” by reception, handed a business card and shooed away.

🇺🇸 Los Angeles: Andrew McCalip, Head of R&D at Varda, a space factory company, reads the description of the LK99 synthesis, and realizes he has most of the equipment in the office. If this is the first room temperature superconductor, there’s no way he’s missing out, so he hustles to secure the ingredients and livestreams the process on Twitch. It is perhaps the most watched stream of a live furnace on the platform in history.

🇨🇳 China: Chinese social media has exploded with speculation. Posts and hoaxes about the LK99 material abound. What is certain is that the materials are widely available, and the process described simple enough, that dozens of labs decide to make an attempt.

🕊️ Twitter: On a widely attended Spaces on Saturday evening, Korean sleuths track down and translate the Korean language scientific papers from Qcenter. They find that a serendipitous accident, the destruction of the quartz capsule on removal from the furnace, resulted in the first sign of the superconductor. This  kink begins suspicion that the manufacturing process described in the papers in insufficient. Andrew McCalip, who is on the space, reacts to the news with a sigh. His materials are cooking, and the furnace removal is upcoming. He fires off questions to a number of people. Teams from multiple places start poring over translated Korean language scientific papers with a fine tooth comb.

🇷🇺 Russia: Soil scientist and anime catgirl Iris, stumbles upon the papers and reads them casually on Friday morning. Russian scientific practice when replicating Western papers is to deconstruct the science into abstraction. Not having the same access to equipment, Russian inquiry delves into the why much more deeply, to concentrate on the essence required to produce the outcome. With that starting point, cursing and swearing in inimical Russian style, she recognizes the smokescreen of the method in both papers immediately, cursing the idiocy of the Korean team (normally it would American, but the curses work just as well on Koreans). You want to produce a crystal, get good quality, well mixed starting inputs, and perform the actual exothermic reaction that produces the desired outcome. She posts her kitchen chemistry process over the weekend, at arrives at 2 confirmed Meissner effect levitation stones, beating all other public teams. She posts the pics on Twitter and begins to indulge in her favorite hobby, insulting the intelligence of westerners. 

📈In Corporate Boardrooms Around The World: Eyebrows are raised, what-ifs are asked, quiet emissaries are despatched.
