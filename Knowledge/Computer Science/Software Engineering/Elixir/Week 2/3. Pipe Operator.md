# Pipe Operator
Elixir provides a solution for simplifying complex nested function calls using the pipe operator (`|>`). The pipe operator takes the result of one expression and passes it as the first argument to the next function call, creating a more readable and maintainable code structure.

### Nested Function Calls
Consider this example of deeply nested function calls:

```elixir
foo(bar(baz(new_function(other_function()))))
```

The pipe operator can simplify this:

```elixir
other_function() |> new_function() |> baz() |> bar() |> foo()
```

The pipe operator takes the result on the left and passes it to the right-hand side.
## Examples
Here are some examples using Elixir's String module:

### Tokenize String

```elixir
"Elixir rocks" |> String.split()
# Result: ["Elixir", "rocks"]
```

### Uppercase Tokens

```elixir
"Elixir rocks" |> String.upcase() |> String.split()
# Result: ["ELIXIR", "ROCKS"]
```

### Check Ending

```elixir
"elixir" |> String.ends_with?("ixir")
# Result: true
```

## Best Practices
When using the pipe operator, if a function's arity is greater than 1, it's recommended to use parentheses for clarity. Although Elixir doesn't require them, using parentheses can prevent ambiguity, especially when reading the code or working with other programmers.

For instance, if you omit parentheses around a function with the pipe operator, you'll get a warning:

```elixir
"elixir" |> String.ends_with? "ixir"
# Warning: parentheses are required when piping into a function call
# It's recommended to use: String.ends_with?("elixir", "ixir")
```

Using parentheses consistently in your code can help improve readability and avoid potential confusion.
