# Minimalism Web Design 2023
Minimalism is a trend that keeps on trending! YouTube refreshed its user interface design for a more modern, minimalist black and greyscale look in mid-2022. The old YouTube-red subscribe button is now black, and secondary CTAs are black on grey.

YouTube’s black and greyscale UI facilitates a seamless user experience between light and dark themes–dark mode is a trend that’s grown in popularity over the last few years.

Many websites and digital products have adopted a similar black and greyscale variation. The benefit of this simple color palette is UI design team can use a single color to make important CTAs and features pop–like this example from the [blogging plaform Ghost](https://ghost.org/).
