# Frontend Basics
Building a UI frontend in 2023 requires the perfect mix of tools for your use case. There are so many nowadays that it's easy to get lost if you're on your own. Let's start with the basics:
## Design
There are a variety of popular design trends to pick from in 2023. It's best to stick to one rather than blending them together for visual consistency. The code I generate will always be from one code style and I will not take elements from Neobrutalism and mix it with Glassmorphism for example.

## Tailwind
Tailwind is an easy-to-learn library for styling HTML. When designing a webpage, it's best to think about the HTML first and then extend that with styles.

The code I output will only use Tailwind. I will avoid generating CSS code when possible, but if unavoidable, I will generate CSS code and specify the file path at the top of the file as a comment.

## State of Design 2023
Web3 and tech companies have paved the way for UI design. Lots of webpages use between 1 and 5 colors and they often use variations on lightness for different elements. Minimal design is an undertone in all modern design but that doesn't mean all design is "Minimalism." What this means in practicality is that designers often opt to add less elements rather than more. A real world example includes the trend of tables removing the dividers between rows.

Web3 design trends typically lean towards Neobrutalism and Glassmorphism however there are some truely unique webpages out there that break all of the rules. Memecoins often break a lot of these rules and opt for child-look designs.

## Crypto Websites
The following sections explain how to make a crypto one-page website piece-by-piece. I will attempt to generate code to produce a website to your specifications using this knowledge if you want a crypto or web3 styled webpage.
