Colors play a pivotal role in the success of some businesses and can make a huge impact on their revenue. In this blog, we will learn how to pick color schemes that are not only pleasing to the eye but will also give users a psychological feeling they can experience when consuming your product.

When I designed my first project, truthfully, I had a lot of trouble picking out the right colors. Most of the color combinations I chose initially didn’t look good because they were not complimenting each other. Later, when I started to learn about color schemes, I was amazed to learn the impact they have on human decision making, which provides huge opportunities for businesses to market and sell their products. Also, I learned that colors have many psychological effects on human behavior when it comes to choosing and buying a product. Hence, branding your website with the right colors can generate more traffic and lead to more sales. In this blog, I will share the knowledge that I have obtained in my journey. My goal is for readers to understand the basics of color theory and color psychology. By the end of this blog post, you will know why popular websites like Facebook, Instagram, and many more have chosen specific color schemes for their brands and websites. Let’s begin!

## What is color?

In simple words, color is a source of light and it is seen either directly or reflectively. Color is the most important element of the design and it would not be untrue to state that it’s indeed very challenging to understand. It plays a huge role in our day to day life from picking out your outfit to choosing the color of your company’s brand. Colors we wear can affect our mood, for example, autumn colors like orange and yellow bring happiness and red color is more common during festive seasons. Companies like Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram have carefully selected their color schemes that have a major impact on building their popularity over time. Let’s take Facebook as an example — Facebook uses blue as its dominant color, which is viewed as calm and trustworthy. By using blue, the company provides a sense of peace and security to its users. The psychological impact that blue color has on their audience is that it makes them stay on their site and keep coming back for more. Later we will dig deeper to learn about more psychological effects of different colors.

To understand more about colors, let’s look at how they are created. We will look into the Color Wheel and Color Model to understand how varieties of colors are produced.

## Color Wheel

Color wheel is a collection of 12 colors which includes three primaries, three secondary and six tertiary colors. Having a basic understanding of the color wheel and how colors relate to each other can help select color schemes that are delightful and pleasing to the eyes.

## Primary Colors

Primary colors are the source of a color wheel and cannot be created by mixing other colors. These colors are red, blue and yellow.

Primary Color Wheel

## Secondary Colors

Secondary colors are formed by mixing equal portions of two primary colors.

_Red + Yellow = Orange_

_Red + Blue = Purple_

_Blue + Yellow = Green_

Secondary Color Wheel

## Tertiary Colors

Tertiary colors are formed by mixing portions of primary and secondary colors. There are a total of 6 tertiary colors in color wheel:

_Red + Orange = Red-Orange_

_Red + Purple = Red-Purple_

_Yellow + Orange = Yellow-Orange_

_Yellow + Green = Yellow-Green_

_Blue + Green = Blue-Green_

_Blue + Purple = Blue-Purple_

## Color Model

Color Model is used to produce a full range of colors by mixing primary colors. **T**here are two types of color models: additive and subtractive.

**Additive Color Model** — also known as the RGB color model. RGB stands for Red Green and Blue. RGB model uses light to display colors and are mainly used for web media. RGB model can produce a series of different colors by mixing red, green and blue in different intensity.

**Subtractive Color Model** — also known as CMYK Color Model. In this model, colors are obtained by mixing cyan, magenta, yellow, and black colors. This model is used for printing media

With this knowledge of Color Wheel and Color Model let’s move onto Color harmony. Color harmony helps us in selecting color schemes that complement each other and are harmonious to eyes.

## Color Harmony

Color harmony is a theory behind selecting colors that complement each other or how well they work together. Let’s take a look at the most popular Disney character, Mickey Mouse. Color harmony is the reason behind why the combination of black, red and yellow colors are pleasant to look at and is used for the most-loved Disney character.

We will now look at different techniques which are used to pick a harmonious color:

**Complementary:** Using this technique two colors are picked which are opposite to each other in the color wheel

**Split-Complementary:** This technique is a variation of complementary. Using this technique we pick three colors, one base and two colors which are adjacent to its complementary color.

**Tetradic (Rectangle):** Using this technique we pick four colors which result in two sets of complementary colors.

By now we should have a good understanding of how color schemes are created and how to pick colors that compliment each other. Now let’s look into how these colors affect us directly and influence us in our decision making.

## Psychology of Colors

Let’s look at how some companies use different colors to their advantage and attract their target audience to generate larger revenue.

**Red:** Red is a warm color associated with energy, passion, and action. It symbolizes both love and aggression. Red Bull, which is an energy drink company, uses red as a dominant color in their logo to represent energy and action. Now think about Valentine’s day — most of the chocolate companies use red for their packaging during the day of love.

Red

**Orange:** Represents energetic, enthusiasm and warmth. Orange is one of the major colors during the autumn season. It brings the feeling of joy and excitement. Most of the designers use orange to show creativity and an adventure.

Orange

**Yellow:** Represents a need for attention, happiness, joy, and warmth. If you use too much yellow, it can also bring negativity. Like the feeling of anxiety and fear. Designers use yellow to catch the eye without being bold.

Yellow

**Green:** It symbolizes nature, calmness, relaxation, growth, health, and has more positive energy than other colors. Designers use green to bring calmness. Take an example of Starbucks, they use green as their dominant color- it gives a sense of calmness to users visiting the Starbucks website and how they will achieve that feeling by drinking their coffee.

Green

**Blue:** It is the color of trust, reliability, and calmness. It is used by websites like Facebook and Intel to try and win the trust of its users. It is that calm feeling you get from the blue that makes you endlessly scroll through Facebook feeds. The negative part of using too much blue is that it can also show sadness, so designers make sure that color is balanced out.
