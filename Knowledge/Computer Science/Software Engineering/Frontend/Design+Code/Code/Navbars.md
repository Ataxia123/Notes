# Navbars
The navbar is at the very top of your page. I often use 56px for the height as a starting point but depending on the design style, it will vary. For newer companies, there's often more padding (on the left and right especially) so naturally the height will be taller. There are exceptions.

## Popular Kinds of Navbars
The common layouts for navbars includes:
- Space between
	- The logo is often on the left and the menu items are on the right side of the navbar.
- Centered
	- The logo is optional but the menu items are centered on the page.
- Asymmetric
	- Either the logo is omitted or the menu items are omitted but not bot.
- No navbar
	- Very simple websites may opt to have no navbar since there's nothing to navigate to.

Some navbars may include social links with the menu items. Other navbars may use dropdowns on-hover or click to show more options. This is common for enterprises or SaaS companies with lots of features.
