**How can I design in the Neo-Brutalism style?**

So I’ve been seeing Neo — Brutalism designs everywhere for a while, I read a couple of articles and saw multiple examples, and videos to learn some basics. This article is a summary of what I’ve learned during this process. Hope you find it useful!

## What is Neo-Brutalism (Neubrutalism) style?

Neo-Brutalism in design uses simple, raw elements to show the basic structure of a website or app. It has special colors and typography. It is a modern take on the Brutalist architecture movement of the mid-20th century. It emphasizes rough, block-like designs.

## What is the difference between Neo-Brutalism, Brutalism, and Minimalism?

**Difference between Neo-Brutalism, Brutalism, and Minimalism** — By

## Brutalism

Brutalism is like a big, flat building made of plain concrete. It doesn’t have any fancy decorations or details, just the basic structure.

## Neo-Brutalism

Neo-Brutalism is like Brutalism, but with more interesting and unique parts added to it. It still keeps the plain look, but has some extra things going on.

## Minimalism

Minimalism is like a simple and clean room with only the bare essentials. It’s easy to use and everything is in its place. There’s not a lot of clutter or extras, just what’s needed.

> _Ok, enough terminology. Tell me how you designed one._

## How to design in Neo-brutalism style?

So I saw multiple examples and they all have some features in common. I categorize them into 3 groups, color, components, and typography.

> _Don’t forget that_ **_you are_** _the designer and you might decide to change things there is no rule written in stone!_

## Color

**Some vibrant colors used in Neo Brutalism trend** — By

-   **Black:** In Neo-brutalism, we use pitch black with no fear! The two most important use cases of black are strokes and dark shadows.
-   **Background color:** In Neubrutalism, we can use multiple colors (other than white and light gray on light mode and dark colors on the dark theme) for the background color! We can use very vibrant colors, and vintage and muted colors.
-   **Vibrant colors:** You can use colors with high saturation.
-   **Vintage and muted colors:** You can imagine you are designing an old magazine or poster and you can use all those colors too.
-   **No gradient:** As far as I saw there are no examples of using gradient in this style. Colors are distinct and don’t have different tones and gradients.

## Example

Let’s redesign the Instagram profile page using some of these rules.

> _By the way, I don’t suggest Instagram changes its design at all, I explained my reasons in the next sections. It is just a fun example!_

1.  Ok first let’s add some strokes and black shadows!
2.  Now let’s change the colors!
3.  And change the typography!

We are done!

Here are some other alternatives, in which I added some raw components and I changed the other elements a little bit.

> Now that I learned it, can I use it on all of my designs?

## Considerations

In Neo-brutalism, elements are very brutal and there are many hard shadows and so many strokes. In my opinion, it’s **not always the best choice** for many situations. Some things to consider:

## **1\. Is the app or software going to have a lot of information and data?**

In Huge systems with high amounts of data and complicated information architecture (IA). Using this style can create so much noise and increases the cognitive load and it is not simplistic.

## **2\. Who is the target audience?**

If the app or software is meant for a lot of different people, this style might not be the best fit.

If the app or software is for kids, older people, or people with disabilities, the style might be too harsh and not friendly enough.

## **3\. How new is the product?**

If people are already used to a certain look and feel for the app or software, changing it to the Neo-brutalist style might upset them.

> OK, where can I use this style?

## Possible use cases of Neo-Brutalism

1.  **Some websites:** It can be used in websites as a small touch and make them different from other similar websites. It can help them stand out.
2.  **Creative portfolios:** People in creative fields like design, photography, and art may choose to use a Neo-brutalist design style for their portfolios to showcase their work in a unique and eye-catching way.
3.  **Experimental software:** Startups or tech companies creating experimental software may use a Neo-brutalist design to convey a sense of innovation and cutting-edge technology. when the product wants to attract people’s attention if it looks different it can do it. We should keep in mind that it is not suitable for complicated software products because they have a lot of components themselves and this style will add a lot of noise to it.
