# Best Google Fonts Combinations for a Modern Website (Including Color Palettes!)
[Design](https://artisanthemes.io/design/)

### The thing with choosing fonts…

If you’re building a website and you’re not precisely a designer, you’ll find yourself facing a big challenge when it comes to choosing the right fonts for it.

It’s definitely not an easy task. Not even for those who work in design.

There’s so many to choose from. Where to start? How can you be sure you’re choosing the right one? How to combine two fonts?

Well, those are questions that you’ll be able to answer with time, gaining experience and learning about typography, if you’d like.

But there’s a shortcut. You can also rely on inspiring yourself by other designers’ combinations.

I prepared for you **10 fail-proof combinations that work**.

### Reliable combinations

These are thought for websites with a modern approach, or that are looking to go through a brand renewal.

All the combinations use Google fonts. And they showcase one typeface for the headings (marked as H) and another one for the body (marked as B).

There’re no weird or too-fanny fonts in here, which can quickly make your design look unprofessional.

All of them are solid and trustable typefaces with proper legibility. And the combinations are meant to create balance so your website looks modern and polished.

**Exclusive Bonus:** [Download](https://app.monstercampaigns.com/c/ypi0g06clktfbgzcrsyn/) the 7 Ways Guide to Make Your Website Look Professional. And improve your site’s credibility!

### How to use these combinations

→ If you’re using one of [our WordPress themes](https://artisanthemes.io/wordpress-themes/), then all you need to do is go to Theme Options » Typography in your WordPress Dashboard.

You’ll find a dropdown menu for the Headings and another one for the Body font. That menu offers you all available fonts from Google, so just choose the one you need and click Save.

→ If you’re not using one of our themes or if you’re coding yourself a website, there’re two steps you need to follow:

**Step 1**: Embed the fonts into your website by adding the embed code as the first element in the < head > of your HTML document.

**Step 2**: Declare the fonts that will be used for body and headings in your styles.css file.

You’ll find both the embed code and the CSS code below each combination, so you can copy-paste them to your files.

### Just one more thing before we begin

I created 10 font combinations that are suitable for any kind of modern website. I tried to cover several styles so you find the one that matches your brand.

But then I thought, why don’t I offer you one more piece of inspiration together with the font combination?

So I added a **color palette** to each one of them, for you to not only grab the fonts you should use but also the colors that go nicely with them.

## 1\. Crimson Text + Work Sans

![Font Combination: Crimson Text + Work Sans](https://b5u2r7a9.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/font-combinations-agency-website-1.png)

If you’re looking for a high-end kind of style, a look that will make your website appear both prestigious and contemporary, this is the combo for you.

Crimson Text –a serif font inspired by old-style typefaces– for the headings, combined with Work Sans –a modern, kind of grotesque sans-serif– for the body, make a solid combination of tradition + modernity.

![Font Combination: Montserrat + Work Sans](https://b5u2r7a9.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/font-combinations-agency-website-7.png)

Bold, bold, bold, geometric, bold… and friendly. If that’s what you’re after, then try this combination.

I don’t have to say much about Montserrat, one of the most beautiful and solid typefaces in the Google Fonts collection.

It’s perfect for modern websites, and you’ll see it adapts itself to many different personalities.

Here we have it on its strongest and thicker side, but it can also serve chic and more delicate styles as well (spoiler alert: combination number 9).

Combine it with Work Sans (light version), a font that I’ve been personally falling in love with for the last months, and you’ll have nothing to worry about. Like, in life. That powerful they are.

![Font Combination: Prata + Lato](https://b5u2r7a9.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/font-combinations-agency-website-8.png)

I can’t hide my love for Prata. It’s an elegant serif typeface with refined curves and strong serifs, which make headlines neat and attractive.

Together with Lato as body font, this blend delivers an audacious but also elegant and minimal style for any website.

## 9\. Montserrat + Lora

![Font Combination: Montserrat + Lora](https://b5u2r7a9.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/font-combinations-agency-website-9.png)

Remember I said Montserrat could serve many different styles and purposes? Here’s the proof.

This combination uses it in all caps and with a light weight, turning your headlines into both delicate and trendy.

Combine it with a clean serif like Lora and a pink or a rose gold palette, and _bum_, you have a feminine styled website for a solopreneur or a modern brand run by a woman.

![Font Combination: Playfair Display + Chivo](https://b5u2r7a9.stackpathcdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/font-combinations-agency-website-10.png)

Luxurious and trendy. That’s the status you can achieve with this combination.

The headings are dressed with Playfair Display, one of the most beautiful serifs from Google Fonts. Use it in italics and your website will look premium and exclusive.

Chivo’s elegance and fine strokes, used in Light, makes it ideal for combining with the strong features of Playfair Display.

What are you waiting to try it out?
