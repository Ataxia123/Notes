# LensGrantFeatures

gm lens devs!

as you may have seen with the recent LensV2 announcement, Lens profiles are EIP-6551 compatible. One of the most exciting use cases for 6551 is the ability to place a Lens profile in the TBA (tokenbound account) of another NFT and then using and operating Lens applications with the NFT like a regular Lens user. In other words, NFTs can become characters with social identities using Lens.

To make this happen , 2 things are required:

1. **Login with NFT on Polygon- this went live yesterday. This only works with Polygon NFTs, though, and needs to be made compatible with ETH NFTs**

2. **Cross-chain bridge receiver contract - this needs to be spun up on Polygon and audited**

We are seeking a smart contract dev who is familiar with Polygonâ€™s [[FxPortal]] to work with us an the Tokenbound team to scope out and build this ASAP!

If you are interested in building this with us, please let us know.
