Aim:

1. Daily Goals: Start with the main objectives you want to achieve for the day. This could be project milestones, tasks, or meetings.

2. Time Blocks: Divide your day into time blocks. Each block should be dedicated to a specific task or activity. This could include brainstorming sessions, coding, meetings, etc.

3. Collaboration Time: Allocate specific time blocks for collaboration. This could be for team meetings, brainstorming sessions, or just time to work together on tasks.

4. Breaks: Don't forget to include breaks. These are important to prevent burnout and maintain productivity.

5. Review: At the end of the day, review your progress. Check off completed tasks and move unfinished ones to the next day.

6. Notes Section: Include a section for notes. This can be used for jotting down ideas, feedback, or important points from meetings.

I want to have a balanced day. I'd like to write something, learn something and also advance at least one of my projects
