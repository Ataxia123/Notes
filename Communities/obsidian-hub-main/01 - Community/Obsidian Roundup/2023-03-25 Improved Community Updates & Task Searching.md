# 2023-03-25: Improved Community Updates & Task Searching
New folder plugins, LLM powered plugins, plugin APIs, improved audio notes support,  and some neat new public vaults.

## In The Community

* The `#updates` channel in the [community Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/obsidianmd?ref=eleanorkonik.com) has a new bot to update folks about new plugins and themes, with support for threaded discussions. It's a lot more pleasant to use now :)

### Pending (as of Friday morning)

__Note: Not all new plugins are available in the community list yet, as they need to go through code review first. You can manually install plugins that aren't in the community list yet by using the [Beta Reviewer's Auto-update Tool](https://github.com/TfTHacker/obsidian42-brat?ref=eleanorkonik.com). Note, though, that this is not as safe as waiting for them to go through code review.__

* [Folder notes](https://github.com/LostPaul/obsidian-folder-notes?ref=eleanorkonik.com) by `@LostPaul` lets users create notes within folders that can be accessed without collapsing the folder, similar to the functionality offered in Notion and the other [Folder Note](https://github.com/aidenlx/alx-folder-note?ref=eleanorkonik.com) plugins.
* [Link Current Folder](https://github.com/ccosnean/link-current-folder?ref=eleanorkonik.com) by `@ccosnean` inserts the current folder path.
* [TagMeOut](https://github.com/tizianococcio/tagmeout?ref=eleanorkonik.com) by `@tizianococcio` extracts the header following each specified tag. It can be useful to create a summary of a note.
* [Askify Sync](https://github.com/helloworldkr/Askify-Obsidian-Sync?ref=eleanorkonik.com) by `@helloworldkr` help to sync notes from [Askify](https://askify.video/?ref=eleanorkonik.com), which lets users take screenshots and notes from YouTube.
* [Flashcard Learning](https://github.com/gaetanmuck/obsidian-flashcard-learning?ref=eleanorkonik.com) by `@gaetanmuck` is an alternate way flashcards can be used inside Obsidian in order to learn and remember things.
* [Page Properties](https://github.com/necauqua/obsidian-page-properties?ref=eleanorkonik.com) by `@necauqua` renders page properties similar to Logseq.
* [External Favicon](https://github.com/ordidxzero/obsidian-external-favicon?ref=eleanorkonik.com) by `@ordidxzero` adds favicon to anchors.

* [Smart Rename](https://github.com/mnaoumov/obsidian-smart-rename?ref=eleanorkonik.com) by `@mnaoumov` renames notes while keeping previous title in existing links.
* [Dynamic Timetable](https://github.com/L7Cy/obsidian-dynamic-timetable?ref=eleanorkonik.com) by `@L7Cy` calculate the estimated time of completion from the estimated time of the task and dynamically creates a timetable.
* [Avatar](https://github.com/froehlichA/obsidian-avatar?ref=eleanorkonik.com) by `@froehlichA` displays an avatar image in your notes.
* [Latex Matrices](https://github.com/Deltekk/Obsidian-Latex-Matrices?ref=eleanorkonik.com) by `@Deltekk` speeds up latex matrices writing.

#### LLM-powered pending plugins

__Reminder: most plugins of this type need to make calls to the internet to function; many need to send your data to external servers to be indexed. Here's a [proposal for possible consent mechanisms for plugins that do so](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/add-consent-mechanism-to-plugins-that-send-your-notes-to-the-cloud/56324?ref=eleanorkonik.com).__

* [Auto Classifier](https://github.com/HyeonseoNam/auto-classifier?ref=eleanorkonik.com) by `@HyeonseoNam` automatically classifies your notes using the ChatGPT API.
* [Markdown GPT Chat](https://github.com/Tagada216/markdown-chat-gpt?ref=eleanorkonik.com) by `@Tagada216` lets users use ChatGPT with a command in Obsidian
* [Companion](https://github.com/rizerphe/obsidian-companion?ref=eleanorkonik.com) by `@rizerphe` is a github copilot-like interface for obsidian that can use ChatGPT under the hood.

## Housekeeping

* I'm so sorry for any broken links you may have experienced last weekend; I am still banging my head against trying to fix the DNS problems for [https://newsletter.eleanorkonik](https://newsletter.eleanorkonik/?ref=eleanorkonik.com) and unfortunately following the directions I'd been given led to a lot more getting busted. I reverted the changes until I get a chance to dive in deeper and round up someone with more expertise than the other people I've already asked for help ðŸ˜…
