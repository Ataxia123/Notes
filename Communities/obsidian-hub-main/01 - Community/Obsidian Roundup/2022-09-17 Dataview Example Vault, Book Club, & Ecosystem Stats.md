# 2022-09-17: Dataview Example Vault, Book Club, & Ecosystem Stats
Memes about minimalism, bullet backlinks plugin, timeshifting, a book club, and an upcoming mystery event.

## In The Community

* For an upcoming mysterious community event, the Obsidian team is looking for speakers to talk about plugin development! DM `Silverica#8456` on Discord if you'd love to give a talk, whether you have a topic in mind or not. In addition to all the community love you get, you might also get a special merch shirt.
* Here's the [ranked voting survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSduBKH9orU7Az1Hp4G9hFEUuyIEfncjYQNTblemtg7StFgLaA/viewform?usp=sf_link) for the Obsidian book club. The deadline for voting is September 20 at 17:00 EST. You can find more details in the `#off-topic` [thread for the book club](https://discord.com/channels/686053708261228577/1009112156064718951/1019217017536004096) in Discord.
* Does anybody have any good guides on how to use n8n for anything related to Obsidian? It feels like there are opportunities to use it, but I generally only hear about Zapier even though n8n is self-hostable. What's up with that?
* Here's a super neat write-up about [Obsidian ecosystem statistics](https://publish.obsidian.md/hub/04+-+Guides%2C+Workflows%2C+%26+Courses/Guides/Obsidian+ecosystem+statistics) including a best guess of how many (estimated) users use Windows, Mac, or (various distributions of) Linux, as well as how many downloads there were for themes and plugins. Only 3 themes have been downloaded more than 100,000 times!
* For those who aren't familiar with it, the [Obsidian Meme subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/ObsidianMDMemes/) is new but a lot of fun, especially this one about [minimalists after installing Obsidian 0.16](https://www.reddit.com/r/ObsidianMDMemes/comments/x4answ/minimalists_after_installing_obsidian_16/)

## Plugin News

### New in Community Plugins

_These plugins went through code review and are now available in Obsidian's plugin list._ For the full list, check out the [plugin stats page](https://obsidian-plugin-stats.vercel.app/new).

* [TikZJax](https://github.com/artisticat1/obsidian-tikzjax) by `@artisticat1` Â renders LaTeX and TikZ diagrams in your notes
* [Janitor](https://github.com/Canna71/obsidian-janitor) by `@Canna71` Â performs cleanup tasks on your vault
* [Todoist completed tasks](https://github.com/Ledaryy/obsidian-todoist-completed-tasks) by `@Ledaryy` Â fetches completed tasks from todoist API and adds them to the Obsidian note.
* [Day and Night](https://github.com/CyberT17/obsidian-day-and-night) by `@CyberT17` Â automatically toggles themes between day theme and night theme on a set time schedule.

* [Auto Hide](https://github.com/skelato1/obsidian-auto-hide) by `@skelato1` Â collapses sidebars when clicking on the editor/viewer panel.

### Pending (as of Friday morning)

_Note: Not all new plugins are available in the community list yet, as they need to go through code review first. You can manually install plugins that aren't in the community list yet by using the [Beta Reviewer's Auto-update Tool](https://github.com/TfTHacker/obsidian42-brat). Note, though, that this is not as safe as waiting for them to go through code review._

* [Influx](https://github.com/jensmtg/influx) by `@jensmtg` is a bullet journaling plugin that aggregates a terse stream of backlinked clippings in the footer of notes. It looks designed for outliners that don't want to mess with folders and tags but do want to use daily notes. If I'm understanding it correctly it should make people used to the Roam/Logseq paradigm intrigued.
* [Custom File Explorer sorting](https://github.com/SebastianMC/obsidian-custom-sort) by `@SebastianMC` Â allows for manual and automatic, config-driven reordering and sorting of files and folders in File Explorer.
* [Image Inserter](https://github.com/cloudy9101/obsidian-image-inserter) by `@cloudy9101` helps users easily search and insert images to editors from Unsplash.
* [3D Graph](https://github.com/AlexW00/obsidian-3d-graph) by `@AlexW00` uses D3.js to create an alternate graph view that lets nodes overlap.
* [Time Tracker](https://github.com/daaru00/obsidian-time-tracker) by `@daaru00` Â lets users add timer widgets.
* [AWS S3 Sync](https://github.com/daaru00/obsidian-aws-s3-sync) by `@daaru00` Â will synchronize vaults with an AWS s3 bucket, making it another option for third party syncing.
* [System Theme](https://github.com/jgauth/obsidian-system-theme) by `@jgauth` is to help Linux users adapt their theme to adapt to the system theme.
* [Publish](https://github.com/addozhang/obsidian-publish-plugin) by `@addozhang` Â makes it easier to upload local images embedded in markdown to a remote store, and export markdown for publishing to static site.
* [Blockquote Levels](https://github.com/czottmann/obsidian-blockquote-levels) by `@czottmann` Â adds commands for increasing/decreasing the blockquote level of the current line or selection.

### Updates

_If you want a comprehensive list of what plugins updated this week, check out this [plugin updates index](https://obsidian-plugin-stats.vercel.app/updates) by Ganessh Kumar._

* [Metadata Menu](https://github.com/mdelobelle/metadatamenu) now supports timeshifting: you can now set shift intervals to push Date fields in the future. It's useful for spaced repetition and project management. Here's [a demo](https://youtu.be/6dEk9no269g).

## Feature Requests

* [Querying by parent bullet](https://github.com/obsidian-tasks-group/obsidian-tasks/discussions/1127) a la a "traditional" outliner would require a complete re-write of the Tasks plugin code... which doesn't mean it's impossible ðŸ‘€ if anyone is up for creating a way to store full information about the tree of indented bullets it is within, I imagine some folks would be grateful.
* Share if you'd like [the vault name to always be visible, even if you click away from the Files pane](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/vault-name-should-always-be-visible/43413/3).

## Appearance

## Showcases

* This is a [dataview example vault](https://github.com/s-blu/obsidian_dataview_example_vault) is a fully functional downloadable vault intended to collect and explain various dataview queries, from based examples to complex javascript based ones. There's also a nice overview section.
* Here's a [vault on github](https://github.com/gigaSecure/Tech-Notes) of about 500 notes about computers, software, programming, etc. There's also a nice list of note-taking methods used in its creation.

## Ancillary Tools

* The Alfred Workflow for Obsidian ([Shimmering Obsidian v.2.27.4](https://github.com/chrisgrieser/shimmering-obsidian#shimmering-obsidian-)) was updated for Obsidian v0.16 and now has support for enabling and disabling plugins via the Advanced URI plugin; 3.0 migrated to Alfred 5 options, re-wrote the docs, and deprecated the Daily Note features -- check out [this alternative](https://github.com/hauselin/obsidian-alfred) if you relied on it.
