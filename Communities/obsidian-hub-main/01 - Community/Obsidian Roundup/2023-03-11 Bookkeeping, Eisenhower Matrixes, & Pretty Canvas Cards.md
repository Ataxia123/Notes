# 2023-03-11: Bookkeeping, Eisenhower Matrixes, & Pretty Canvas Cards
An interview with Obsidian's new CEO, workflow tips, and a personal note about the Silicon Valley bank run (I'm fine; I hope you are too).

## In The Community

* Nicole van der Hoeven and Andy Polaine interviewed Stephan Ango (aka `@kepano`) about [the future of Obsidian](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TkNTuFF2t-c&ref=eleanorkonik.com).

## Plugin News

### Pending (as of Friday morning)

## Personal

* You may have heard that there was [a bank run on Silicon Valley Bank](https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2023-03-10/startup-bank-had-a-startup-bank-run?ref=eleanorkonik.com). Given the demographics of this community I have to assume at least some folks were impacted. Words are relatively useless in a situation like this, but I'm wishing everyone the best and hoping that Monday brings good news.
