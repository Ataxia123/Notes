# 2022-11-26: Weekly Reviews, Zen Mode, & Aggregation
System commands & tips for making notes useful.

## In The Community

_Note: a bunch of great things happen in Discord every week, but the links require you to be logged in to [the community server](https://obsidian.md/community) and generally launch in the browser version of Discord unless you paste them into your app directly. Sorry!_ 

* [r/ObsidianMD](https://www.reddit.com/r/ObsidianMD/) now has 50,000 members ðŸ¤¯ Here is a fun discussion about the [growth of the community](https://www.reddit.com/r/ObsidianMD/comments/yzkyfm/obsidianmd_subreddit_growth_vs_other_apps_only/), complete with a graph.
* Obsidian has [playlists on youtube](https://www.youtube.com/@obsdmd/playlists), including resources for Obsidian for PhDs, university, and plugin building.

## Plugin News

### New in Community Plugins

_These plugins went through code review and are now available in Obsidian's plugin list._ For the full list, check out the [plugin stats page](https://obsidian-plugin-stats.vercel.app/new).

* [Obsidian Handlebars Template Plugin](https://github.com/sbquinlan/obsidian-handlebars) by `@sbquinlan` Â adds support for handlebars template blocks in notes.
* [Dirtreeist](https://github.com/k4a-l/obsidian-dirtreeist) by `@k4a-l` Â renders a directory Structure Diagram from markdown lists in codeblocks.
* [Chorded Hotkeys](https://github.com/ConnorMeyers/obsidian-chorded-hotkeys) by `@ConnorMeyers` Â lets users type multiple letters at the same time to trigger text insertion, template insertion, or command execution.

### Pending (as of Friday morning)

_Note: Not all new plugins are available in the community list yet, as they need to go through code review first. You can manually install plugins that aren't in the community list yet by using the [Beta Reviewer's Auto-update Tool](https://github.com/TfTHacker/obsidian42-brat). Note, though, that this is not as safe as waiting for them to go through code review._

* [AI Text Generator](https://github.com/samyosm/obsidian-ai-text-generator) by `@samyosm` Â lets users generate text from a prompt using the GPT-3 API.
* [Obsidian S3](https://github.com/TechTheAwesome/obsidian-s3) by `@TechTheAwesome` Â allows for storage and retrieval of media attachments on S3 compatible services.
* [Weekly Review](https://github.com/brandonkboswell/weekly-review) by `@brandonkboswell` Â opens all of the files you have created in the last week.

* [External Link Helper](https://github.com/nakalsio/obsidian-danpung) by `@nakalsio` Â makes entering external links easier.
* [Tray](https://github.com/dragonwocky/obsidian-tray) by `@dragonwocky` Â will let users launch Obsidian on startup and run it in the background from the system tray.
* [Aggregator](https://github.com/Seraphli/obsidian-aggregator) by `@Seraphli` Â helps users gather information from files, and make a summary in the file.
* [ProZen](https://github.com/cmoskvitin/obsidian-prozen) by `@cmoskvitin` Â expands the current tab to full screen, removing everything but content.

* [Strange New Worlds](https://github.com/TfTHacker/obsidian42-strange-new-worlds) popups will now by default get cut off at 100 files, although the number can be controlled in settings. This should improve speed.

## Discussions

* SÃ©bastien Dubois' article about [why to take and make notes](https://dsebastien.net/blog/2022-11-16-why-take-notes) sparked an interesting [discussion on HackerNews](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33691341).

## Showcases

* Here's a neat way to [handwrite on a tablet to get bullet journal style notes](https://www.reddit.com/r/ObsidianMD/comments/z2jfwf/obsidian_bullet_journal_handwriting_in_my_s6_tab/) in Obsidian.

## Housekeeping

Thursday was Thanksgiving here in the USA, but my family is celebrating today. I wanted to take a moment and let you all know how deeply grateful I am for the opportunities that have come my way because of you. I'm planning to quit teaching soon, for health reasons I'll get into more detail about once the dust has settled, but it wouldn't be possible without all of your support, financial and otherwise.
