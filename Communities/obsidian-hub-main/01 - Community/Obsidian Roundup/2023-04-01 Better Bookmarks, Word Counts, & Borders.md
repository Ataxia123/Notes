# 2023-04-01: Better Bookmarks, Word Counts, & Borders
Natural language syntax highlighting, improved reviews and habit trackers, and a nifty way to leverage Google for searching your vault.

## Obsidian Updates

* [Insider v1.2.0](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/obsidian-release-v1-2-0-insider-build/57173?ref=eleanorkonik.com) added a new Bookmarks core plugin, allowing users to bookmark files, folders, graphs, searches, headings, and blocks. It also improved the UI for search and hotkey settings, and improved the behavior of alises for files with paths.

### Pending (as of Friday morning)

__Note: Not all new plugins are available in the community list yet, as they need to go through code review first. You can manually install plugins that aren't in the community list yet by using the [Beta Reviewer's Auto-update Tool](https://github.com/TfTHacker/obsidian42-brat?ref=eleanorkonik.com).
