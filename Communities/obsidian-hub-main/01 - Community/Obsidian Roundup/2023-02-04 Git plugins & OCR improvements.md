## Plugin News

### Pending (as of Friday morning)

## Housekeeping

A few folks have reached out wondering if there's anything they can do to help out since I've been having a tough time with my pregnancy (my [osteitis pubis problems](https://www.eleanorkonik.com/postpartum-osteitis-pubis/) are back and more gnarly than ever). I'm due in late July, so sometime in June I'm probably going to put out an official request for guest posts to help make sure the newsletter doesn't go radio silent when I am busy being sleep-deprived with a newborn.

If you've got any interest in writing up an article of basically any kind as long as it's interesting, and having it hosted here on the newly-minted Obsidian Iceberg, think about it and let me know so I can gauge interest and start planning. 

To see some examples of this in action, Chris Grieser did with [how to take big notes and how to take small notes](https://www.eleanorkonik.com/one-size-fits-all-how-to-take-big-notes-and-how-to-take-small-notes/) for Obsidian October, and Tahereh Safavi wrote one about the [possible relationship between selective female infanticide / polygyny to the Viking age](https://www.eleanorkonik.com/berserker-queen/) once when I got really sick, so it's not without precedent. Hopefully this will be fun for community members to share info about stuff they're passionate about for folks who don't necessarily want go thru the effort of setting up a whole blog for a one-off thing.
