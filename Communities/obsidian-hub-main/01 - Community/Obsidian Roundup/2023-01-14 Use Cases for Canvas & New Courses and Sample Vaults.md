# 2023-01-14: Use Cases for Canvas & New Courses and Sample Vaults
Mobile has Canvas now, you can render 3D model files, and there's a new Clockify integration.

## Housekeeping

The Great Newsletter Consolidation of 2023 is happening now. Don't panic but some things might break or be wonky while I hunt down unexpected problems and fix themüòÖI've got professionals helping me but technology has a way of breaking when I'm around no matter what I do, and the actual changes will stretch into next week. 

Anyway, the website looks a little different, and more importantly, there are _lots_ of new articles on a wide variety of topics. As such, there's a new name: this is now the Obsidian Iceberg, of which the Obsidian Roundup is a (large!) subset. Email subscribers should continue to only receive Obsidian Roundup content unless you specifically [opt in to the extra stuff](https://www.eleanorkonik.com/#/portal) (sign in, there _should_ be a list and a checkbox), but RSS subscribers might want to switch their feed over to [the Roundup specific tag](https://www.eleanorkonik.com/tag/roundup/rss/) if they aren't interested in [book reviews](https://www.eleanorkonik.com/untitled/), [musings on AI](https://www.eleanorkonik.com/spite), the [history of sleep across species and cultures](https://www.eleanorkonik.com/sleep/), etc.

For the roughly 500 of you who were subscribed to both Eleanor's Iceberg and the Obsidian Roundup, this should make things easier for you. It will _certainly_ make things easier and cheaper for me, and I'm grateful that Ghost has added features that allow me to do this, because while my actual publication schedule will not change at all, this means I can stop maintaining two entirely different sets of newsletter infrastructure.

## Obsidian Updates

[Insider v.1.1.10](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/obsidian-release-v1-1-10-insider-build/52005) got a bunch of quality of life improvements, like a new ‚ÄúNarrow to block‚Ä¶‚Äù menu option for Canvas, and a new Canvas settings tab for configuring Canvas preferences for your entire vault. [v1.1.11](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/obsidian-release-v1-1-11-insider-build/52017) and [v1.1.12](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/obsidian-release-v1-1-12-insider-build/52159) involved small bugfixes.

[Mobile Insider v1.4.2](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/obsidian-mobile-v1-4-2-insider-build/52006) brings Canvas to Mobile, as well as a vault picker and a configurable ribbon menu (for phones).

You can manually install plugins that aren't in the community list yet by using the [Beta Reviewer's Auto-update Tool](https://github.com/TfTHacker/obsidian42-brat).

* [Plugin Groups 1.3.0](https://github.com/Mocca101/obsidian-plugin-groups/releases/tag/1.3.0) got a major UI rework that makes it possible for editing groups to be organized in tabs. It's also possible to bulk (de)select and filter.

## Guides

* Nicole van der Hoeven has an Obsidian course now. [Obsidian for Everyone](https://courses.nicolevanderhoeven.com/o4e/slp7k) focuses on practical tutorials instead of methodologies. It's self-paced, has an accompanying sample vault and PDF handbook, and focuses on a plugin-free experience. The [first lesson is available free on Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNFF_EeFr9Y).
* Nick Milo's [Obsidian Flight School 2.0](https://www.linkingyourthinking.com/obsidian-flight-school) vault launched on [ProductHunt](https://www.producthunt.com/posts/obsidian-flight-school-2-0). It's designed to make users faster, more skilled, & more confident using plugins, hotkeys, formatting, etc.
* Here's how to use Mermaid and Dataview to create an automatically updating Gantt chart of [what you've read throughout the year](https://joschua.io/posts/2023/01/11/mermaid-reading-gantt-charts/).
* This is a fantastic guide about how to use [Obsidian as an academic operating system](https://twitter.com/Artifexx/status/1613858822988103681).
* Here's how to [add "on this day" photos to your daily journal](https://www.reddit.com/r/ObsidianMD/comments/106pp3c/tutorial_how_to_add_on_this_day_photos_daily/).

## Discussions

* Here was a great discussion on Reddit about [how different people take notes while browsing](https://www.reddit.com/r/ObsidianMD/comments/1063e6r/what_do_you_use_to_take_notes_while_browsing/).

## Showcases

* Here's how Nicole van der Hoeven gets stuff done using [Rapid Logging in Obsidian](https://youtu.be/V3-A6j17KsI), along with a really neat [sketch note via Ellane W](https://pkm.social/@ellane/109644922709540589).
* Here's Leah Ferguson on [using Dataview for daily logs](https://pkm.social/@leah/109610523183016473).
* [Bramses' Highly Opinionated Vault](https://github.com/bramses/bramses-highly-opinionated-vault-2023), which incorporates a great many knowledge management philosophies like zettelkasten, PARA, AGILE, etc., was updated for 2023.
* `@edmund` shared a neat way to [use Canvas for Zettelkasten](https://discord.com/channels/686053708261228577/1050087185602334833/1061768157716549783) in Discord. Other Canvas showcases included a [workout plan](https://discord.com/channels/686053708261228577/1050087185602334833/1062367607874920538) and this [tech stack canvas](https://www.reddit.com/r/ObsidianMD/comments/1050fqi/obsidian_canvas_appreciation_post/).
* Here's Nick Milo's [top 44 plugins](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVQGrn9gQKI) and a Reddit thread of [plugins people think people should know](https://www.reddit.com/r/ObsidianMD/comments/107u00u/10_obsidian_plugins_everyone_should_know/).

## Food For Thought

* Here's some insight into [what how AI might influence our notes in the future](https://every.to/superorganizers/the-end-of-organizing), and a [response from Benjamin Shafii on the forum](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/take-messy-notes-and-make-them-clear-jotting-is-the-future-of-note-taking/51986) about how actually the real advantage of plugins like AVA is that they let you turn messy jotted notes into coherent longform things you could send to a friend. Like Benjamin, I don't look forward to any of the things in that article: I don't really want AI to organize my notes for me at all. I don't particularly trust it, because if I could programmatically and intelligently do that in a way even another human could do, I would have already automated the process already). I do not _want_ automated linking and tagging and I [have yet to find the autocompletes valuable for writing](https://www.eleanorkonik.com/spite/). That said, one thing I have found super useful is [Readwise's Ghostreader function](https://twitter.com/deadly_onion/status/1592990487257829376), which lets me input my highlights and summarize an article based only on what I cared about; it's been useful to shove at the top of my notes. There's no obvious reason this can't be replicated with one of Obsidian's many AI plugins.

## Ancillary Tools

* Here's how to [send Mastodon Bookmarklets to Readwise using Zapier](https://empty.coffee/sending-mastodon-bookmarks-to-readwise-zapier/).
* Here's a neat [weird old book finder](https://debugger.medium.com/a-search-engine-that-finds-you-weird-old-books-3a74fbb5f3d4) I stumbled across recently. The idea of it is to get away from algorithmic content and just ... read an old book it serves up to you, one at a time.
