# 2022-11-05: Email Fetching, Fancy Templating & Improved Longform Writing
Fields for tags, academic workflows, & a great method for using Obsidian to improve onboarding at a new job.

## In The Community

__Note: a bunch of great things happen in Discord every week, but the links require you to be logged in to [the community server](https://obsidian.md/community) and generally launch in the browser version of Discord unless you paste them into your app directly. Sorry!__

* Here's a great thread on [how to show appreciation to plugin developers](https://twitter.com/TfTHacker/status/1588041762798374912). Speaking of which, here is `@WebInspectInc`'s [nine favorite Obsidian plugins](https://obsidian.rocks/super-powers-for-obsidian-nine-of-the-best-obsidian-plugins/).

## Plugin News

### New in Community Plugins

__These plugins went through code review and are now available in Obsidian's plugin list.__ __For the full list, check out the [plugin stats page](https://obsidian-plugin-stats.vercel.app/new).__

* [Projects](https://github.com/marcusolsson/obsidian-projects) by `@marcusolsson` is an awesome new plugin to help manage projects in Obsidian; it aligns the most relevant parts of kanbans, databases, and calendars to give you just the aspects of those things you need to handle projects, and I can't wait to integrate it into my vault.

### Pending (Happy Obsidian October!)

__Note: Not all new plugins are available in the community list yet, as they need to go through code review first. You can manually install plugins that aren't in the community list yet by using the [Beta Reviewer's Auto-update Tool](https://github.com/TfTHacker/obsidian42-brat). Note, though, that this is not as safe as waiting for them to go through code review.__

* [QuranLookup](https://github.com/abuibrahim2/quranlookup) by `@abuibrahim2` is a Quran Lookup plugin for Obsidian. This replaces chapter:verse shorthand with verse text in Arabic and translation.

* [New Note New Window](https://github.com/Pr0dt0s/new-note-new-window) by `@Pr0dt0s` will generate a new file, just like the "Create new note" command, and put it in a new window.
* [Bionic Reading](https://github.com/Quorafind/Obsidian-Bionic-Reading) by `@Quorafind` enables bionic reading mode in Live preview mode of Obsidian.

## Guides

* Here is a nice discussion of [why a former Roam user likes Obsidian](https://www.deliberate-diligence.com/i-was-wrong-obsidian-is-better-than-roam-after-all/) and how their daily-note / chronology based notetaking system works.
* `@Sultanofswing` recently wrote a 10,000 word academic paper in Obsidian using Zotero, the Zotero Integration plugin, and Pandoc. Here's [the explanation of how](https://discord.com/channels/686053708261228577/722584061087842365/1037760641303334943) in Discord.
* Nicole van der Hoeven made [a video about how she uses Zsolt Viczian's LATCH (Location, Alphabet, Time, Category, and Hierarchy) method](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vS-b_RUtL1A) for organizing notes in Obsidian.
* Here's how to [use embedded queries to simplify note management](https://heymichellemac.medium.com/how-i-use-embedded-queries-in-obsidian-to-simplify-my-note-management-9aba527e4a03).
* There were a couple of discussions about [different formats](https://twitter.com/TfTHacker/status/1586991375790182401) people use for [home notes](https://twitter.com/josephhinkle/status/1587261116111065089).
* Here's how one user used Obsidian and Anki to [onboard better with a new job](https://sherlock.codes/blog/effective-onboarding-at-a-new-job/).

## Showcases

* Kepano is [using the Text Generator plugin to generate recipes](https://twitter.com/thehighpony/status/1588632265206034432) and it immediately made me wonder whether AI will __finally__ be able to take a list of ingredients I have in my pantry and just tell me what to cook.
* A bunch of people shared their [favorite small features](https://www.reddit.com/r/ObsidianMD/comments/yhq61k/whats_a_lesser_known_feature_that_you_absolutely/).

## Courses

* Bianca Pereira launched her “Build Your Knowledge Portfolio” course. She teaches professional and amateurs researchers how to organize knowledge in a “no folders” system to support writing research-based content. Here's a [15% discount link](https://biancapereira.gumroad.com/l/build-your-knowledge-portfolio/ROUNDUP_GAMMA).

## Ancillary Tools

* Here's a guide for [pairing Obsidian and Logseq](https://twitter.com/fuzzygel/status/1586217261580230656).
* [Acreom is now in 1.0](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33451711) - like Logseq, it can run on top of an Obsidian vault, but unlike Logseq, it is not an outliner and doesn't involve bullet points. It can also sync your notes to the a browser version like GitHub hosted visual studio code, but without messing with Git. It's a more task management and calendar focused app than Obsidian is, but if you're looking for a straightforward way to get your plain text Obsidian notes into a browser for your work computer where you can work with them 🙃 it's less frustrating than most of the other options.
* Here's a [tool for batch converting Daylio entries](https://github.com/DeutscheGabanna/Obsidian-Daylio-Parser) (a journaling & mood tracking app) into Markdown notes.
