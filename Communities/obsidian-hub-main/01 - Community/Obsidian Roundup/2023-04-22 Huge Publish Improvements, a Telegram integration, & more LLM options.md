# 2023-04-22: Huge Publish Improvements, a Telegram integration, & more LLM options
New plugins for scientists & storytellers. Guides for knowledge management & new features. Plus, a review of a year in Obsidian.

## In The Community

* A grad student at Georgia Tech is doing [a survey about improving the Obsidian interface for better human-computer interaction](https://www.reddit.com/r/ObsidianMD/comments/12rg7ox/survey_followup_research_for_obsidian_for/?ref=eleanorkonik.com). Consider filling it out if you've got some time.

## Obsidian Updates

* Obsidian Publish [now offers more for less](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/obsidian-publish-now-offers-more-for-less-a-lower-price-with-new-features-improved-seo-and-accessibility/58272?ref=eleanorkonik.com): a lower price, with new features, improved SEO and accessibility. For Insiders on v.1.2.5 there's also new [navigation customization options](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/obsidian-release-v1-2-5-insider-build/58384?ref=eleanorkonik.com), along with a series of fixes. Specifically Obsidian Publish now supports overriding SEO/social metadata with three new YAML keys: `description` overrides the meta description (you can remove Markdown that way if you want). `permalink` overrides the URL/slug. `image` or `cover` accepts an image URL or vault asset, and overrides the auto generated share card. Kepano also [announced on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/ObsidianMD/comments/12qtwt3/comment/jgrzwff/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) that there will be news about plugin support for Publish in the future.

You can manually install plugins that aren't in the community list yet by using the [Beta Reviewer's Auto-update Tool](https://github.com/TfTHacker/obsidian42-brat?ref=eleanorkonik.com).
