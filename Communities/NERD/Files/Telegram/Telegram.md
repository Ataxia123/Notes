Abstract: Spawned from a Twitter influencer's page. Pond Coin. The general gist of this is that the usecase is unknown but the contract original launched from people sending Pauly's ethereum wallet a random assortement of eth, even though he promised them nothing, and remained bullish on $Pepe token. He was the owner behind some fairly famous nft projects, like crypto phunks as well as some others. The contract contained code called brutalize that allowed users with the know how to transfer anyones token amounts to themselves to sell, causing much havoc in the launch, which was aparently intentional, and disqualified people from "mining" pond coin, which was the legitimate launch, and the rumor is that it yeilds pepe to the true PNDC miners who mine through the website.

***

**Forwarded from [At0x.eth | Nerd Finance](https://t.me/At0xNQ)**

#At0x_Tips when you want to analize big data you have to identify what are the uncorrelated data types we can get access to

for example:

- On-Chain data 
- Twitter sentiment

***

**Forwarded from [At0x.eth | Nerd Finance](https://t.me/At0xNQ)**

if you have them spread out it gives you predictive power because sentiment changes before on chain (sometimes)

Ticker: Toshi
Contract: 0x8544fe9d190fd7ec52860abbf45088e81ee24a8c
Chain: Base
MktCap: $27.3m 
Abstract: Toshi is a shib/doge attempt at Base Chain, coinbase's recently launched L2. The website build took time, and they've locked a great deal of liquidity (1.48million) with the contract renounced and passing all basic screeners like honeypot and tokensniffer. Locked liquidity. Their goal is to be the first base chain token to be listed on coinbase proper. A preliminary glance at their verified code shows me that it has airdrop, burn, and mint features. On reading their twitter, they seem to be very big fans of Base chain, having been ramping up to its launch and deployment and anticipating it in advance. They've listed on a few centralized exchanges and have a moderately active community. There was a hack on LeetSwap on base chain, where their original Liquidity was, but they have since rescued their tokens, and begun trading on sushiswap for basechain.

Some simple stuff like - Total Value Locked. - Market cap (Circulating supply / fully diluted supply). - maybe set some criteria for reference to Large / Mid / Small / Micro caps. - Analysis of the largest holders I.e. bubble maps.

Ticker: BOOST
Contract: 0x71e8f538f47397cd9a544041555cafc7a0ce9ae3
Chain: Base
MktCap: $9.93m 
Abstract: 813 holders and 6,000 transfers, seems a bit odd for looking into the contract, which is increadibly basic and just there to mint the tokens. Boost claims to be involved with perpetual trading, first aggregator and P2P perpetual protocol on base. recently had a 70 eth sell off, which was bought up. it allows leverage perpetuals at around 100x, and is person to person (P2P). Socials look good, funding rates seem low. They also have developer docs which tend to increase confidence as developers can make tooling for the specific protocol in question. Most of the trading on their basescan contract page looks like normal swapping and buying, though there are some slightly suspicious transactions that seem to be liquidating relatively fractional amounts of base and multisending them to different contracts/wallets. This could just be exchanges or taxes, but its worth noting that the contract doesnt imply there are any taxes. the docs make note of the following under their tokenomics page:
Total Supply: 1,000,000,000
Circulating supply : 220,000,000
Vested supply : 780,000,000
Circulating supply at TGE: 22%
Initial Liquidity Provision on Base: 20% of the total BOOST supply will be combined with ETH to form an initial liquidity pool.
Team Allocation: 10% of the total BOOST supply is earmarked for the team, with a vesting period extending over 12 months and a cliff period of 3 months.
Rewards and Farming: 60% of the BOOST supply is reserved for trading rewards and farming incentives. Linearly unlocked over 2 years.
Foundation: 10% of the BOOST supply is reserved for the BOOST Foundation. 2% at TGE, the rest will be linearly unlocked over a year.

Its also worth noting that i cant seem to find a working example yet. There are a lot of words, but text is fairly cheap. That combined with a low-holder-to-high-mktcap-ratio seems a little suspicious. There are two contracts deployed currently one for their token, and one for Boost Vesting, likely some sort of staking mechanism.

Contract: 0x8Fbd0648971d56f1f2c35Fa075Ff5Bc75fb0e39D
Chain: Base, Solana
MktCap: $1.47m 
Abstract: MBS seems to be an ingame currency for MonkeyLeague, a game that they have launched. It appears as though their nfts were launched on solana and are now using Base for their in game currency purchages, though solana is still an option. the game is mobile and currently in alpha, though they do have a link to try out the alpha game. Since it's mobile, there is some question as to how they utilize so many onchain transaction capabilities. It also stands out that they lauched on solana first...a while ago...So it gives me pause. Their game demo seems to be a soccar game that you need to buy nfts to build a team with it. A breif overview of their socials tell me that they have a lot of followers.The company has been around for a while, (oct 2021) but appears to have just launched its token on Base, perhaps as an attempted to maintain relevancy or market to more users. 
Gating the game access with nfts (not sure that they're doing this or not) is problematic, espeially with cross chain nfts. There isnt any info as to how the tokens get used with the protocol except text saying that they'll be for ingame items. The development team as clearly been around though, and it would seem they held a cash tournament.

Wonder how much we can do from inside telegram

Lets schedule a play test soon. Yeah I think getting a working version inside telegram would be massive, and we could have lots of people test it.

I have a few research questions that I could put up a bounty for. Additionally theres somethings happening in ReFi and Defi right now, and I think piling on and incentivizing people to create an open source brain is the definition of a public good. Could get some initial funding and clients from that space.
