Abstract: Chinese word for Ethereum. Inspiration was derrived from an ethereum movie. Would seem to be meme tax at about 1% tax (probably both buy and sell). website has no additional information except for that. the twitter also seems to point towards a chinese movie called "no more bets" as inspiration. But it did 3.9m volume in the last 24 hours, and 16.29m in the last 7 days.

Chain: Ethereum
MktCap: $79.5m 
Abstract: Spawned from a Twitter influencer's page. Pond Coin. The general gist of this is that the usecase is unknown but the contract original launched from people sending Pauly's ethereum wallet a random assortement of eth, even though he promised them nothing, and remained bullish on $Pepe token. He was the owner behind some fairly famous nft projects, like crypto phunks as well as some others. The contract contained code called brutalize that allowed users with the know how to transfer anyones token amounts to themselves to sell, causing much havoc in the launch, which was aparently intentional, and disqualified people from "mining" pond coin, which was the legitimate launch, and the rumor is that it yeilds pepe to the true PNDC miners who mine through the website.

@mattim0use

***

**Forwarded from [mattimouse](https://t.me/mattim0use)**

good question

***

**Forwarded from [mattimouse](https://t.me/mattim0use)**

depends on what they are looking for

***

**Forwarded from [mattimouse](https://t.me/mattim0use)**

for instance, if they just want to do trend analysis

***

**Forwarded from [NERD](https://t.me/nerdmn1)**

what are they looking for?

***

**Forwarded from [mattimouse](https://t.me/mattim0use)**

then the highest gainers work, so they know what kinds of things to make or kinds of things to invest in

***

**Forwarded from [NERD](https://t.me/nerdmn1)**

do we know this?

***

**Forwarded from [At0x.eth | Nerd Finance](https://t.me/At0xNQ)**

we need to impress them rn

***

**Forwarded from [mattimouse](https://t.me/mattim0use)**

***

**Forwarded from [At0x.eth | Nerd Finance](https://t.me/At0xNQ)**

***

**Forwarded from [At0x.eth | Nerd Finance](https://t.me/At0xNQ)**

***

**Forwarded from [NERD](https://t.me/nerdmn1)**

***

**Forwarded from [NERD](https://t.me/nerdmn1)**

***

**Forwarded from [NERD](https://t.me/nerdmn1)**

maybe we can use current winners to identify meta or category strength

***

**Forwarded from [mattimouse](https://t.me/mattim0use)**

it will all work and be added to the same repo and be data for the brain

***

**Forwarded from [NERD](https://t.me/nerdmn1)**

***

**Forwarded from [At0x.eth | Nerd Finance](https://t.me/At0xNQ)**

ok data science tip [[At0x_Tips]]

***

**Forwarded from [NERD](https://t.me/nerdmn1)**

- Look at contract for funding source - Check previous instances of contract to check for previous deployements - is liquidity Locked - Is the contract renounced - Taxes on the token - Quick twitter search for socials

***

**Forwarded from [At0x.eth | Nerd Finance](https://t.me/At0xNQ)**

#At0x_Tips when you want to analize big data you have to identify what are the uncorrelated data types we can get access to

for example:

- On-Chain data 
- Twitter sentiment

***

**Forwarded from [At0x.eth | Nerd Finance](https://t.me/At0xNQ)**

if you have them spread out it gives you predictive power because sentiment changes before on chain (sometimes)
