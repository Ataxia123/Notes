## BLOG

--> Ethereum is like an Iceberg.

What most people see = the front ends and current UX is possible because of a constellation of libraries.

Originally these libraries were made by passionate devs who needed these tools themselves.

Over time VC funds have started to try and take more control of the ecosystem by achieving "Vertical Integration"

-> The main offender is Paradigm: 
-> Invested in:
- Wagmi
- Foundry
- rETH

# the Open Source Stack
Public [HACKMD NOTE](https://hackmd.io/PsX0bLy_RmuK0BYT9p5e5w)


## Current Status:

[useDapp](https://usedapp.io/) creator joined the chat
-> package needs to be updated from v5 -> v6

Long term funding for Ethers ecosystem:

The stub repo for now: https://github.com/ethers-io/ext-react

## Idea List: 

1)  Use Quadratic posts  [more info](https://www.quadraticlenster.xyz/posts/0x01a14e-0x011f)
    - Create a post describing what ethers does and its importance for the ecosystem  
2) BuidlGuild Scaffold kit using useDapp 
3) Explain the plight of ethers
    - Staying open source is important.
    - Funds are investing $$$$ to achieve vertical integration
    - Start a conversation about "THE OPEN SOURCE STACK" 
        - Dependencies required to successfuly develop "ANY" EVM chain without censorship
        - Includes:
            -> **JS Libraries** to interact with the chain [Ethers](https://ethers.org/)
            -> **State management** libraries to handle accounts/providers/txs [useDapp](usedapp.io)
            -> **Testing libraries** and smart contract deployment frameworks [Hardhat ](hardhat.org)
            -> **Integrated Framework** for web3 Development [scaffold-eth](https://github.com/scaffold-eth/scaffold-eth-2)
            -> **git hosting** [Radicle](https://radicle.xyz/)
            -> **Web hosting providers** [fleek](fleek.xyz)
            -> **RPC providers** [Ankr](https://www.ankr.com/)
            -> **DATA STORAGE** [Arweave](https://www.arweave.org/)
            -> **Middleware** [LitProtocol](https://litprotocol.com/)
