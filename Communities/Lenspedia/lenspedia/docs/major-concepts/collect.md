# Collect

Collects allow creators to monetize their content. Because creators own their content via the Lens Protocol, they are able to allow their followers to purchase that content.

When a user posts a [publication](https://docs.lens.xyz/docs/publication) to their [Profile NFT](https://docs.lens.xyz/docs/profile) they have the option to set a Collect Module. This module will allow other users to mint NFTs that link to the publication's ContentURI. This module can contain any arbitrary logic to apply to the minting process and the resulting NFT.

A creator can attach a collect module that allows collecting to be open for a certain amount of time or only allow a certain number of collects. Developers can also make their collect modules to add even more functionality!
