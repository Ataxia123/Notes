# Comment

Comments allow users to provide additional commentary on other publications. They are treated the same as base [Publications](https://docs.lens.xyz/docs/publication) with extra checks and features. Like publications, comments live in the user's [Profile NFT](https://docs.lens.xyz/docs/profile) and therefore are wholly owned by the user.

Since comments reference other publications, they are subject to the original publication's Reference Module conditions. If a publication has a reference module that limits comments only to accounts who [follow](https://docs.lens.xyz/docs/follow) the original poster, and the commenter does not hold a Follow NFT, the transaction to comment will fail.

Just like regular publications, comments also have Collect and Reference Modules. Collect modules define how a comment can be minted into an NFT that references the comment's ContentURI. The Reference module contains logic that determines who can comment or mirror the new comment.
