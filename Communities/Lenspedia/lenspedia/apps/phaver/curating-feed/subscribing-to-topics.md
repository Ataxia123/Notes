# Subscribing to topics

Using topics is Phavers' way of organising information into particular to groups&#x20;

You can manage your subscription to topics that interest you in a couple of ways

1. From the discovery page directly by clicking on the plus icon next to the topic
2. Subscribe directly from a topic page by clicking on a particular topic
3. If you want to unsubscribe from a topic you can do so by clicking the checkmark on the discovery page or clicking the "Subscribe" button in the topic page itself
