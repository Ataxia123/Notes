# Mobile Devices
The cornell.css snippet includes adjustments for displaying cues and summaries with narrow screens, such as mobile devices.

When a screen is narrow, the cue will not appear in a column, rather will remain a simple cue in line with the flow of the document.

The following is how one of the sample documents looks on a desktop computer.

>[!cue] Cues on the desktop

The following is how the same document appears on a mobile device. Notice how the cue is shown as a callout rather than in the margin.

>[!cue] Cues on mobile in portrait mode

However, on a mobile device in landscape view, if the screen is wide enough, the column for cues are shown:

>[!cue] Cues on mobile in landscape mode

#### Customizing mobile screen width
This width of a "narrow" screen, or mobile screen is defined in cornell.css and can be customized for your devices. See [[Customizing the CSS#Screen width for mobile devices|Customizing the cornell CSS]] for more information on how to do this.
