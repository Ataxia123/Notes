# Install and Configure the Templater plugin

These are instructions to install the Templater Plugin and configure it for use with this vault.

The Templater plugin enables advanced [[Using Templates|templates inside Obsidian]]. A template is a document that contains text and commands that are frequently used in a vault. Templates save us time by helping us perform frequent tasks. Templater is one of the more popular plugins in the Obsidian universe.

This plugin is not installed into this vault by default, since some users do not want to run 3rd party plugins. If you want to use the templates included in this vault, you will need to install and configure the Templater plugin. This page will show you how.

## Step1: Install Templater
As shown in the following animation, go into Obsidian's settings, and in Community Plugins install the Templater plugin.
