# Cornell Note-Taking System

>[!Info] Before getting started ...
>Before going further, we need to know a bit of the history of the Cornell Note-Taking System, along with how it was used on paper before we can dive into the modern-day equivalent of using this method in Obsidian. So stick with me till the end so you get a grasp of the key ideas behind Cornell Notes.

## My Introduction to Cornell Notes

>[!cue] **Cornell Notes**
>We will use _Cornell Notes_ as a shorthand when referring to the _Cornell Note-Taking System_ 

I was first introduced to the Cornell Notes about 30 years ago. Back then, taking notes on paper was still the norm, as digital note-taking wasn't as accessible. We wanted to take notes digitally, but laptops were bulky and mobile devices weren't as advanced.

I still have notes from classes and work meetings from those years and I am astounded by how useful they are even to this day. In fact, I sometimes still refer to those class notes and it is like I am transported back in time and am sitting in the classroom listening to the professor explain a subject. The reason these notes are so good is that I used the Cornell Note-Taking System.

Cornell Notes are truly powerful due to their visual layout, focus on capturing straightforward cues that will spark a mental recollection of essential topics and questions, as well as summarizing the material learned during a class.

I use the Cornell Note-Taking System for classroom learning, meeting notes, notes on books I was reading as well as for creative thinking. I often combined them with mind mapping. Both forms of note-taking are visually stimulating and complement one another.

Even though this system was originally designed for paper, I have always tried to adapt its core principles to my digital note-taking, even though it wasn't always possible to do so in the visual way typical for Cornell Notes. That is until recently, as we can now use some Obsidian tricks to achieve similar effects.

## A brief history
>[!cue] Origin 
>Developed by Walker Pauk at Cornell University in the 1950s

The Cornell Note-Taking System is a popular method for organizing and summarizing information, especially during lectures or study sessions. It was developed by Walter Pauk, an education professor at Cornell University, in the 1950s as a way to help students better understand and retain information.

The Cornell Note-Taking System has since become widely recognized and adopted in various educational settings worldwide, but its name remains a tribute to the university where it was first developed and introduced.

The main goal of this system is to encourage active learning by promoting critical thinking, effective review, and efficient summarization. It helps to identify the most important points, connect ideas, and actively engage with the material.

While often taught in academic settings, it can be used for a wide range of note-taking needs.


## What is a Cornell Note?
Take a look at this image and we will break it down into its various parts.

>[!cue] Three Sections:
>- Notes
>- Cues
>- Summary

![[Intro-Layout-CN.png]]

The paper is structured into three distinct sections. The left-hand side comprises a small column, which represents approximately 1/5th of the paper. The right-hand side occupies the larger column, taking up the remaining horizontal space. Finally, at the bottom, there is a small section solely designated for summarizing the main ideas.

The three sections are:
* **Notes**: The wide right-hand column is where you can easily jot down your notes. Often, the main ideas are grouped together, leaving some space between them. However, you can also take short notes here.
* **Cues**: The narrow left-hand column is reserved for cues or hints at the main ideas to the right. The cues are designed to help trigger your memory, assisting you in remembering and synthesizing the captured ideas.
* **Summary**: At the bottom of the page, there is a concise summary of the main ideas from your notes. This section compels you to simplify your notes into a few words, making it easier to recall the main points.

## What are the benefits of Cornell Notes? 
>[!cue] **Benefits of Cornell Notes**
>- Active Learning
>- Memory Retention
>- Better Understanding

The Cornell Note-Taking System offers several benefits for students and professionals alike, making it an effective method for organizing and summarizing information. Some of the key benefits include:

1. **Improved organization**: The Cornell system's structure, with designated sections for main ideas, cues, and a summary, helps keep notes organized and easy to read.

2. **Active learning**: The process of identifying main points, writing questions, and summarizing encourages active engagement with the material, which is crucial for understanding and retaining information.

3. **Better comprehension**: By focusing on the most important concepts and summarizing them, users can better understand the information and make meaningful connections between ideas.

4. **Efficient review**: The cue column with keywords and questions makes it easy to review the material and test one's understanding without re-reading entire sections of notes.

5. **Enhanced retention**: Actively engaging with the material and reviewing it using the Cornell method helps improve long-term retention of information.
  
6. **Versatility**: The Cornell Note-Taking System can be adapted for use in various subjects, disciplines, and settings, including lectures, seminars, meetings, and personal study sessions.

7. **Time-saving**: By promoting efficient note-taking and review, the Cornell method can save time, allowing users to focus on other aspects of their studies or work.
