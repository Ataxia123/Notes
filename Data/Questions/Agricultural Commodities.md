Agricultural commodities are raw materials or primary goods that are derived from agricultural activities. They include various crops, livestock, and other agricultural products that are either used as inputs in the production of other goods or consumed directly.

Here are some examples of agricultural commodities:

1. [[Crops]]: This category includes grains, oilseeds, and other cultivated plants. Examples include wheat, corn, rice, soybeans, barley, oats, cotton, coffee, cocoa, sugar, and various fruits and vegetables.

2. [[Livestock]]: Agricultural commodities also encompass livestock and animal products. This includes cattle, hogs, poultry (chickens, turkeys, ducks), sheep, goats, and dairy products like milk, cheese, and butter.

3. [[Forestry Products]]: Some agricultural commodities are derived from forests, such as timber, wood products, and pulp used in the paper industry.

4. [[Fish and Seafood]]: Aquatic products like fish, shellfish, and other seafood are also considered agricultural commodities.

Agricultural commodities are influenced by a range of factors, including weather conditions, natural disasters, disease outbreaks, technological advancements, government policies, and global supply and demand dynamics. These factors can impact the production, availability, and prices of agricultural commodities.

Agricultural commodities are traded on commodity exchanges, where investors and market participants can buy and sell contracts representing these commodities. The trading of agricultural commodities allows producers, consumers, and investors to manage price risks and participate in the market.

It's important to note that investing in agricultural commodities carries inherent risks, including price volatility, weather-related risks, and geopolitical factors. Investors should carefully assess market conditions, conduct thorough research, and consider risk management strategies before engaging in agricultural commodity investments.
