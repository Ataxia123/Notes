Energy commodities are a category of commodities that are related to energy production and consumption. These commodities play a crucial role in powering various industries and are essential for economic activities. Energy commodities can be broadly classified into three main types:

1. [[Crude Oil]]: Crude oil is a major energy commodity and the most actively traded one. It is a naturally occurring liquid fossil fuel extracted from underground reservoirs. Crude oil is refined into various petroleum products such as gasoline, diesel, jet fuel, and heating oil. The price of crude oil is influenced by factors such as global demand, geopolitical events, production levels, and supply disruptions.

2. [[Natural Gas]]: Natural gas is a clean-burning fossil fuel primarily composed of methane. It is used for heating, electricity generation, and as a feedstock for various industrial processes. Natural gas is traded in both spot and futures markets, and its price is influenced by factors such as supply and demand dynamics, weather conditions, storage levels, and geopolitical factors.

3. [[Coal]]: Coal is a combustible black or brownish-black sedimentary rock that is primarily used as a fuel source for electricity generation and industrial processes. It is traded in global markets, with prices influenced by factors such as demand from power plants, environmental regulations, mining and transportation costs, and global energy trends.

Other energy commodities include refined petroleum products such as gasoline, heating oil, and jet fuel. These products are derived from crude oil through refining processes and are essential for transportation and heating purposes.

Energy commodities are traded on various exchanges worldwide, including the New York Mercantile Exchange (NYMEX) and the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE). Investors can participate in energy commodity markets through futures contracts, options, exchange-traded funds (ETFs), and other derivative instruments.

It's important to note that energy commodity prices can be highly volatile due to factors such as global economic conditions, geopolitical events, weather patterns, and supply and demand imbalances. Investors should carefully assess market conditions, conduct thorough research, and manage risks when engaging in energy commodity investments.
