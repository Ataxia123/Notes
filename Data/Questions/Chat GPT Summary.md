Tokenization is a data security process that replaces sensitive information with non-sensitive tokens. These tokens have no intrinsic value and are used as references to the original data. The process involves converting the data into tokens using cryptographic functions, making it difficult to reverse the process without access to the tokenization system. Tokenization systems require secure storage and validation, and they are used to protect sensitive data such as credit card information, medical records, and personally identifiable information. Tokenization is often used in credit card processing to minimize the exposure of sensitive data. It differs from encryption in that it does not alter the length or type of data, making it more flexible and efficient. Tokenization systems have components such as token generation, token mapping, token data store, encrypted data storage, and management of cryptographic keys. Tokenization is compliant with PCI DSS standards and is supported by industry standards such as ANSI, PCI Council, Visa, and EMV. It reduces the risk of data breaches and can simplify the requirements of PCI DSS. However, not all data can be tokenized, and secure communication channels must be established between the sensitive data and the tokenization system.
