# [Financial Instruments Explained: Types and Asset Classes](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/financialinstrument.asp)
 What Is a Financial Instrument?
----------

Financial instruments are assets that can be traded, or they can also be seen as packages of capital that may be traded. Most types of financial instruments provide efficient flow and transfer of [capital](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/capital.asp) all throughout the world’s [investors](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/investor.asp). These [assets](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/asset.asp) can be in the form of cash, a contractual right to deliver or receive cash or another type of financial instrument, or evidence of one’s ownership in some entity.

Examples of financial instruments include stocks, exchange-traded funds (ETFs), bonds, certificates of deposit (CDs), mutual funds, loans, and derivatives contracts, among others.

 Understanding Financial Instruments
----------

Financial instruments can be real or virtual documents representing a legal agreement involving any kind of monetary value. Equity-based financial instruments represent ownership of an asset. Debt-based financial instruments represent a [loan](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/loan.asp) made by an investor to the owner of the asset.

[Foreign exchange](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/foreign-exchange.asp) instruments comprise a third, unique type of financial instrument. Different subcategories of each instrument type exist, such as preferred share equity and common share equity.

 Types of Financial Instruments
----------

Financial instruments may be divided into two types: cash instruments and derivative instruments.

###  Cash Instruments  ###

###  Derivative Instruments  ###

 Types of Asset Classes of Financial Instruments
----------

Financial instruments may also be divided according to an [asset class](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/assetclasses.asp), which depends on whether they are debt-based or equity-based.

###  Debt-Based Financial Instruments  ###

Short-term debt-based financial instruments last for one year or less. Securities of this kind come in the form of [Treasury bills (T-bills)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/t/treasurybill.asp) and [commercial paper](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/commercialpaper.asp). [Bank deposits](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bank-deposits.asp) and [certificates of deposit (CDs)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/certificateofdeposit.asp) are also technically debt-based instruments that credit depositors with [interest](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/interest.asp) payments.

[Exchange-traded derivatives](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/exchange-traded-derivative.asp) exist for short-term, debt-based financial instruments, such as short-dated interest rate futures. [OTC derivatives](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/052815/what-overthecounter-derivative.asp) also exist, such as [forward rate agreements (FRAs)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/fra.asp).

Long-term debt-based financial instruments last for more than a year. Long-term debt securities are typically issued as [bonds](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bond.asp) or [mortgage-backed securities (MBS)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mbs.asp). Exchange-traded derivatives on these instruments are traded in the form of fixed-income futures and options. OTC derivatives on long-term debts include [interest rate](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/interestrate.asp) swaps, interest rate caps and floors, and long-dated interest rate options.

###  Equity-Based Financial Instruments  ###

Securities that trade under the banner of equity-based financial instruments are most often [stocks](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/stock.asp), which can be either common stock or preferred shares. [ETFs](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/e/etf.asp) and [mutual funds](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/m/mutualfund.asp) may also be equity-based instruments.

Exchange-traded derivatives in this category include [stock options](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/stockoption.asp) and equity futures.

###  Foreign Exchange Instruments  ###

[Foreign exchange (forex, or FX)](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/forex/11/why-trade-forex.asp) instruments include derivatives such as [forwards](https://www.investopedia.com/articles/active-trading/102313/why-forward-contracts-are-foundation-all-derivatives.asp), [futures](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/f/futures.asp), and [options](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/option.asp) on [currency pairs](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/currencypair.asp), as well as [contracts for difference (CFDs)](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/contractfordifferences.asp). Currency [swaps](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/swap.asp) are another common form of forex instrument. In addition, forex traders may engage in spot transactions for the immediate conversion of one currency into another.

 The Bottom Line
----------

A financial instrument is effectively a monetary contract (real or virtual), which confers a right or claim against some counterparty in the form of a payment ([checks](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/check.asp), [bearer instruments](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/b/bearer-instrument.asp)), equity ownership or dividends (stocks), debt (bonds, loans, deposit accounts), currency (forex), or derivatives (futures, forwards, options, and swaps). Financial instruments can be segmented by asset class, and as cash-based, securities, or derivatives. Depending on their type, financial instruments may be exchangeable on listed or OTC markets.
