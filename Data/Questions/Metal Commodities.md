- [[Gold]]: Gold is a highly sought-after precious metal known for its value and use as a store of wealth. It is also used in jewelry, electronics, and certain industrial applications.
- [[Silver]]: Silver is another precious metal used in jewelry, silverware, and industrial applications such as electronics, solar panels, and photography.
- [[Platinum]]: Platinum is a rare and valuable metal used in jewelry, catalytic converters, electrical contacts, and various industrial applications.
- [[Palladium]]: Palladium is primarily used in catalytic converters for vehicles, as well as in electronics and jewelry.

2. [[Industrial Metals]]: Industrial metals are widely used in manufacturing, construction, infrastructure development, and other industrial applications. Some commonly traded industrial metals include:

- [[Copper]]: Copper is a widely used industrial metal due to its excellent electrical conductivity and corrosion resistance. It is used in electrical wiring, plumbing, construction, and various industrial applications.
- [[Aluminum]]: Aluminum is a lightweight metal used in transportation, packaging, construction, and the aerospace industry.
- [[Nickel]]: Nickel is used in stainless steel production, batteries, and various industrial applications.
- [[Zinc]]: Zinc is primarily used in galvanizing steel to prevent corrosion, as well as in batteries, alloys, and other industrial applications.

Metal commodities are traded on exchanges such as the [[London Metal Exchange]] (LME) and the [[Chicago Mercantile Exchange]] (CME). Investors can participate in metal commodity markets through futures contracts, options, ETFs, and other derivative instruments.

The prices of metal commodities are influenced by factors such as global economic conditions, supply and demand dynamics, geopolitical events, technological advancements, and investor sentiment. It is important for investors to carefully assess market conditions, conduct thorough research, and manage risks when engaging in metal commodity investments.
