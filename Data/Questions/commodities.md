Commodities are raw materials or primary goods that are used in the production of other goods or consumed directly. They can be categorized into several broad groups, including agricultural commodities, energy commodities, and metal commodities.

1. [[Agricultural Commodities]]: These include crops, livestock, and other agricultural products. Examples include wheat, corn, soybeans, coffee, sugar, cattle, and poultry. Agricultural commodities are influenced by factors such as weather conditions, supply and demand dynamics, and government policies.

2. [[Energy Commodities]]: These are commodities related to energy production and consumption. They include crude oil, natural gas, gasoline, heating oil, and coal. Energy commodities are influenced by geopolitical events, global demand, production levels, and supply disruptions.

3. [[Metal Commodities]]: Metal commodities include precious metals like gold, silver, platinum, and palladium, as well as industrial metals like copper, aluminum, nickel, and zinc. These commodities are used in various industries, including construction, manufacturing, and electronics. Factors influencing metal commodity prices include global economic conditions, supply and demand dynamics, and geopolitical factors.

Commodities are often traded on specialized exchanges, such as the [[Chicago Mercantile Exchange]] (CME) or the [[London Metal Exchange]] (LME). Investors can participate in commodity markets through various instruments, including futures contracts, options, exchange-traded funds (ETFs), and commodity-based mutual funds.

Commodity prices can be highly volatile due to factors such as global economic conditions, geopolitical events, weather patterns, and supply and demand imbalances. They are also influenced by speculation and investor sentiment. As a result, commodity trading carries inherent risks, and investors should carefully assess market conditions and conduct thorough research before engaging in commodity investments.
