#### Rules to Game By<br><br>[â€“]<br><br>As the Dungeon Master, you are the final authority when it comes to rules questions or disputes. Here are some guidelines to help you arbitrate issues as they come up.<br><br>- When in doubt, make it up! It's better to keep the game moving than to get bogged down in the rules.<br>    <br>- It's not a competition. The DM isn't competing against the player characters. You're there to run the monsters, referee the rules, and keep the story moving.<br>    <br>- It's a shared story. It's the group's story, so let the players contribute to the outcome through the actions of their characters. Dungeons & Dragons is about imagination and coming together to tell a story as a group. Let the players participate in the storytelling.<br>    <br>- Be consistent. If you decide that a rule works a certain way in one session, make sure it works that way the next time it comes into play.<br>    <br>- Make sure everyone is involved. Ensure every character has a chance to shine. If some players are reluctant to speak up, remember to ask them what their characters are doing.<br>    <br>- Be fair. Use your powers as Dungeon Master only for good. Treat the rules and the players in a fair and impartial manner.
