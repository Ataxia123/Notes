Understanding how these density waves emerge, or conversely get suppressed by external parameters, provides an important insight into their nature. Here we use spectroscopic imaging scanning tunneling microscopy to study the evolution of density waves in the heavy fermion spin-triplet superconductor UTe2 as a function of temperature and magnetic field. We discover that charge modulations, composed of three different wave vectors gradually weaken but persist to a surprisingly high temperature T_CDW ~ 10-12 K. By tracking the local amplitude of modulations, we find that these modulations become spatially inhomogeneous, and form patches that shrink in size with higher temperature or with applied magnetic field. Interestingly, one of the density wave vectors along the mirror symmetry has a slightly different temperature onset, thus revealing an unexpected decoupling of the three-component CDW state. Importantly, T_CDW determined from our work matches closely to the temperature scale believed to be related to magnetic fluctuations, providing the first possible connection between density waves observed by surface probes and bulk measurements. Combined with magnetic field sensitivity of the modulations, this could point towards an important role of spin fluctuations or short-range magnetic order in the formation of the primary charge density wave. △ Less

Due to the coupling of superconductivity and magnetism in this system, the magnetic moment precession of the ferromagnetic layer caused by the magnetic component of external radiation can lock the Josephson oscillations, which results in the appearance of the particular type of steps in the current-voltage characteristics, completely different from the well known Shapiro steps. We call these steps the Buzdin steps in the case when the system is driven only by the magnetic component and the chimera steps in the case when both magnetic and electric components are present. Unlike the Shapiro steps where the magnetization remains constant along the step, here it is changing though the system is locked. The spin-orbit coupling substantially contributes to the amplitude, i.e., the size of these steps. Dramatic changes in their amplitudes are also observed at frequencies near the ferromagnetic resonance. Combinations of the Josephson and Kittel ferromagnetic resonances together with different types of locking pronounced in dynamics and current-voltage characteristics make the physics of this system very interesting and open up a series of novel applications. △ Less

Our calculations found that without the Cu doping the lead apatite crystal is an insulator with a flat band above the Fermi lever. Furthermore, our results indicate that by introducing the O1 vacancies would results in the disappear of the flat bands in the undopped crystal. While the Cu is doped forming the LK-99, there exist the ultra-flat bands crossing the Fermi level induced by the doped Cu atoms, which is due to the hybridization between the d states of the Cu atoms and the p states of the fully occupied 1/4 occupied O1 atoms. Moreover, we point out that the hybridization maybe the key for the realization of the room temperature superconductivity for the LK-99, and a possible solutions method to improve the quality of the superconductivity is proposed. Our work provides a foundation for the future studies on the unique electronic and the superconductivity properties of the LK-99 crystal. △ Less

    Superconductivity near the Mott-Ioffe-Regel limit in the high-entropy alloy superconductor (ScZrNb)1−x(RhPd)x with a CsCl-type lattice

The studied material is a partially ordered CsCl-type structure, with two sublattices, randomly occupied by Sc, Zr, Nb (first sublattice) and Nb, Rh, and Pd (second sublattice). Calculations were done using the Korringa-Kohn-Rostoker method with the coherent potential approximation (KKR-CPA) and take into account the substitutional disorder. Our total energy calculations confirm the preference for the partially ordered structure over the fully random {\it bcc}-type one. Electronic densities of states N(E), dispersion relations, and McMillan-Hopfield parameters η (electronic contribution to electron-phonon coupling) are studied as a function of composition. The computed increasing trends in N(EF) and η with x are opposite to what we expected based on the experimental results, where the decrease in the critical temperature with increasing x was found. Very strong electron scattering due to disorder is observed, as the electronic dispersion relations are strongly smeared. As a result, the computed electronic lifetimes τ are very short, leading to a small mean-free path of electrons of the order of interatomic distance, which puts (ScZrNb)1−x(RhPd)x near the Mott-Ioffe-Regel limit. The trend in τ(x) is similar to the trend observed experimentally in Tc(x), suggesting that disorder may be the factor that influences Tc in this series of alloys. △ Less

A similar phenomenon can occur in strongly correlated systems, in particular in the fractional quantum Hall effect (FQHE), as the system quasiparticles have a charge e/m different from the electron charge. We study theoretically a setup involving two quantum point contacts (QPC) in the FQHE where Andreev reflection occurs, as charges e/m impinging on the second QPC can only be transmitted as charges e, with the reflection of holes of charge e(1−m)/m . Using the bosonization formalism, and out-of-equilibrium Keldysh Green function techniques, we provide a full analytical calculation of the current correlations at the outputs of the QPC, both at zero and finite temperature. The ratio between the auto- and cross-correlations of the output currents is a direct manifestation of Andreev reflection. Our results agree with recent experimental observations, and give precious information on the temperature dependence of this ratio. △ Less

Hydrogen cage structures have been identified as a common motif beneficial for high critical temperatures Tc. Efforts are now focused on finding hydride high-temperature superconductors at lower pressures. We present evidence for high-temperature superconductivity in binary La4H23 with A15-type structure featuring hydrogen cages at a pressure of P = 95 GPa. We synthesise La4H23 from a lanthanum film capped with a palladium catalyst promoting the dissociation of hydrogen. In resistance measurements, we observe superconductivity with a transition temperature Tc = 90 K. In X-ray diffraction on the same sample, we identify the A15-type cubic body centred structure of the lanthanum sublattice. From comparison with earlier XRD and structure prediction studies, we identify this phase with La4H23. Our study reinforces the concept of hydrogen cages for high-temperature superconductivity. △ Less

In addition to the conventional singlet pairing, we also consider the recently proposed equal-spin triplet pairing, which couples to the singlet at finite in-plane magnetic fields. While both singlet and triplet order parameters are immune to intravalley scattering, they are significantly affected by intervalley scattering. In the realistic regime of strong ISOC, we find that the properties of the superconductor are well described by a simple formula reminiscent of the well-known Abrikosov-Gor'kov theory, but with a modified self-consistency condition. Our results enable straightforward self-consistent calculation of singlet and triplet order parameters and the density of states of disordered Ising superconductors, which can be particularly useful for interpreting recent tunneling spectroscopy experiments in these systems. We also investigate the high-energy features in the density of states, the so-called mirage gaps, and discuss how they are modified by triplet pairing. △ Less

When operated in the transmon regime the device -- that we call ``d-mon'' -- becomes insensitive to offset charge fluctuations and, importantly, exhibits at the same time energy level spectrum with strong anharmonicity that is widely tunable through the device geometry and applied magnetic flux. Crucially, unlike previous qubit designs based on d-wave superconductors the proposed device operates in a regime where quasiparticles are fully gapped and can be therefore expected to achieve long coherence times. △ Less

Density functional theory (DFT) calculations suggest that the conduction electrons are from the doped Cu atoms with valence close to d9. Motivated by this picture, we build a two-orbital Hubbard model on a triangular lattice formed by the dxz and dyz orbitals with total hole density (summed over spin and orbital) n=1−p. When p=0, the system is in a Mott insulator within this model. When p>0, we derive a t−J model and perform a self-consistent slave boson mean field calculation. Interestingly we find a s-wave pairing in contrast to the one-orbital t-J model which favors d+id pairing. S wave pairing should be more robust to disorder and may lead to high Tc superconductor with sufficiently large values of t and J. However, the DFT calculations predict a very small value of t and then the Tc is expected to be small. If LK99 is really a high Tc superconductor, ingredients beyond the current model are needed. We conjecture that the doped Cu atoms may distort the original lattice and form local clusters with smaller Cu -Cu distance and thus larger values of t and J. Within these clusters, we may locally apply our t-J model calculation and expect high Tc s-wave superconductor. Then the superconducting islands couple together, which may eventually become a global superconductor, an insulator or even an anomalous metal depending on sample details. △ Less

The discontinuous transition to the superconducting phase is a general feature of superconductors that include odd-frequency Cooper pairs. ▽ More We discuss the instability of uniform superconducting states that contain the pairing correlations belonging to the odd-frequency symmetry class. The instability originates from the paramagnetic response of odd-frequency Cooper pairs and is considerable at finite temperatures. As a result, the pair potential varies discontinuously at the transition temperature when the amplitude of the odd-frequency pairing correlation functions is sufficiently large. The discontinuous transition to the superconducting phase is a general feature of superconductors that include odd-frequency Cooper pairs. △ Less

The samples were prepared by the solid-state reaction method and characterized by various techniques. The parent compound (x = 0) showed the onset temperature Tc onset of 15 K, and zero-resistance temperature, Tc offset of 12 K. The addition of Pb enhances the metallic characteristics of FeSe0.5Te0.5, but both Tc onset and Tc offset are decreased to the lower temperature with the broadened transition width. The Tc onset is nearly the same (10.3 K) at higher additions, such as x = 0.3 and 0.4, but zero resistivity is not observed up to 7 K. Microstructural analysis and transport studies suggest that for x > 0.05, Pb additions weakened the coupling between grains and suppressed the superconducting percolation, leading to a broad transition. More importantly, the inclusion of a relatively small amount of Pb (x = 0.05) increased the critical current density, Jc, in the entire magnetic field, which might be attributable to better phase uniformity as well as good grain connectivity. △ Less

The many-body spectrum displays a 4π Josephson periodicity, with the states in each Z2 being energetically decoupled. Signatures of the new states appear in the fractional Josephson current when the edge velocities are taken to be different. △ Less

However, superconductors at normal temperatures have yet to be identified. Additionally, there are still many unknown factors and gaps of understanding regarding this unique phenomenon, particularly the connection between superconductivity and the fundamental criteria to estimate the critical temperature. To bridge the gap, numerous machine learning techniques have been established to estimate critical temperatures as it is extremely challenging to determine. Furthermore, the need for a sophisticated and feasible method for determining the temperature range that goes beyond the scope of the standard empirical formula appears to be strongly emphasized by various machine-learning approaches. This paper uses a stacking machine learning approach to train itself on the complex characteristics of superconductive materials in order to accurately predict critical temperatures. In comparison to other previous accessible research investigations, this model demonstrated a promising performance with an RMSE of 9.68 and an R2 score of 0.922. The findings presented here could be a viable technique to shed new insight on the efficient implementation of the stacking ensemble method with hyperparameter optimization (HPO). △ Less

We derive a sum rule of the optical activity in general electric states and show that the summation of the spectrum is zero, which is independent of the details of electric states. The optical activity has a δ-function singularity that vanishes in normal phases. However, the singularity emerges in superconducting phases, corresponding to the Meissner effect in the optical conductivity. The spectrum decreases by the superconducting gap and has a missing area compared to the normal phase. This area is exactly equivalent to the coefficient of the δ-function singularity due to the universal sum rule. Furthermore, the coefficient is exactly equivalent to the superconducting Edelstein effect, which has not yet been observed in experiments. Thus, this measurement of the missing area offers an alternative way to observe the superconducting Edelstein effect. △ Less

They are Josephson junction networks composed of Josephson junctions and normal resistor-inductor-capacitor (RLC) components, working with the fluxoid-quantization principle and Josephson effects to achieve unique flux-modulated dynamics and characteristics; they react to the vector potential of magnetic fields rather than the electric potential. However, the conventional circuit diagrams and nodal analysis methods focus on the electric charges flowing though branches and nodes, ignoring dynamics of the magnetic fluxes flowing from loop to loop. This article introduces a general flux-based circuit theory to unify the analyses of Josephson junction circuits and normal RLC circuits. This theory presents a magnetic-flux-generator (MFG) concept to unify Josephson junctions and normal circuit elements, and abstract both Josephson junction circuits and normal RLC circuits as MFG network; it derives a general network equation to describe dynamics of Josephson junction circuits, and invents a kind of magnetic-flux flow (MFF) diagram to depict the working principles of magnetic-flux flows inside Josephson junction circuits. The flux-based theory is complementary to the conventional circuit theories in the design and analysis of superconductor integrated circuits. △ Less

    Abstract: …superconductors. ▽ More The recent discovery of high-Tc superconductivity in bilayer nickelate La3Ni2O7 under high pressure has stimulated great interest concerning its pairing mechanism. We argue that the weak coupling model from the almost fully-filled dz2 bonding band cannot give rise to its high Tc, and thus propose a strong coupling model based on local inter-layer spin singlets of Ni-dz2 electrons due to their strong on-site Coulomb repulsion. This leads to a minimal effective model that contains local pairing of dz2 electrons and a considerable hybridization with near quarter-filled itinerant dx2−y2 electrons on nearest-neighbor sites. The strong coupling between two components provides a composite scenario to achieve high-Tc superconductivity. Our theory highlights the importance of the bilayer structure of superconducting La3Ni2O7 and points out a potential route for the exploration of more high-Tc superconductors. △ Less

Although spin-dependent tunneling generates quantum spin fluctuations even in the absence of a bias, the formation of spin-triplet Cooper pairs necessary for the creation of magnetization is blocked by destructive interference between different quasi-electron and quasi-hole tunneling channels, unless there is an asymmetry between the tunneling densities of states for electrons and holes. Breaking the symmetry in the electron-hole tunnel density of states and creating electron-hole tunneling imbalance by biasing the device destroys the destructive interference and enables triplet Cooper-pair formation. As a result, magnetizing the superconductor becomes possible. The role of the voltage in lifting the blockade hindering the spin-triplet Cooper pair formation is an example of an electrically-controlled dissipation-less spintronic phenomenon. △ Less

    Abstract: …the high-pressure synthesis method is a highly efficient way to improve the superconducting transition, grain connectivity, sample density, and also pinning properties of a superconductor. ▽ More A series of FeSe0.5Te0.5 bulk samples have been prepared through the high gas pressure and high-temperature synthesis (HP-HTS) method to optimize the growth conditions, for the first time and investigated for their superconducting properties using structural, microstructure, transport, and magnetic measurements to reach the final conclusions. Ex-situ and in-situ processes are used to prepare bulk samples under a range of growth pressures using Ta-tube and without Tatube. The parent compound synthesized by convenient synthesis method at ambient pressure (CSP) exhibits a superconducting transition temperature of 14.8 K. Our data demonstrate that the prepared FeSe0.5Te0.5 sealed in a Ta-tube is of better quality than the samples without a Ta-tube, and the optimum growth conditions (500 MPa, 600°C for 1 h) are favourable for the development of the tetragonal FeSe0.5Te0.5 phase. The optimum bulk FeSe0.5Te0.5 depicts a higher transition temperature of 17.3 K and a high critical current density of the order of >10^4 A/cm^2 at 0 T, which is improved over the entire magnetic field range and almost twice higher than the parent compound prepared through CSP. Our studies confirm that the high-pressure synthesis method is a highly efficient way to improve the superconducting transition, grain connectivity, sample density, and also pinning properties of a superconductor. △ Less

However not much work has been done in identifying this in the standard models in the literature. Here we introduce a model based on a proximity induced superconducting Bismuth bilayer, to directly calculate the thermal Hall conductance based on the lattice model. This model serves as a demonstration of the state of the art possible in such a calculation, as well as introducing an interesting paradigmatic topological superconductor with a rich phase diagram. We demonstrate the quantized thermal Hall plateaus in several different topological phases, and compare this to numerical calculations of the Chern number, as well as analytical calculations of the Chern number's parity invariant. We demonstrate that it is possible to get a reasonable topological phase diagram from the quantized thermal Hall calculations. △ Less

The MZM is expected to emerge at the vortex core of topological superconductors as a zero-energy vortex bound state (ZVBS), amenable to detection using scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy (STM/STS). However, the typical energy resolution of STM/STS has made it challenging to distinguish the MZM from the low-lying trivial vortex bound states. Here, we review the recent high-energy-resolution STM/STS experiments on the vortex cores of Fe(Se,Te), where the MZM is expected to emerge, and the energy of the lowest trivial bound states is reasonably high. Tunneling spectra taken at the vortex cores exhibit a ZVBS well below any possible trivial state, suggesting its MZM origin. However, it should be noted that ZVBS is a necessary but not sufficient condition for the MZM; a qualitative feature unique to the MZM needs to be explored. We discuss the current status and issues in the pursuit of such Majorananess, namely the level sequence of the vortex bound states and the conductance plateau of the ZVBS. We also argue for future experiments to confirm the Majorananess, such as the detection of the doubling of the shot noise intensity and spin polarization of the MZM. △ Less

By analyzing linear dichroism in soft x-ray absorption and core-level hard x-ray photoemission spectra, the 4f symmetry is determined as Σ-type Γ7, promoting predominant hybridization with the conducting electrons originating from the Ge site. The band structures probed by the soft x-ray angle-resolved photoemission indicates that the Ge 4p components contribute to the band renormalization through the anisotropic hybridization effects, suggesting that the control of the electronic structures of Ge orbital gives an impact to achieve the exotic phenomena in CeNi2Ge2. △ Less

However, the high cost of nanofabrication and the difficulty of preparing high-quality interfaces between the two dissimilar materials are common obstacles that hinder the observation of intrinsic physics and the realisation of scalable topological devices and circuits. Here, we demonstrate an innovative method to directly draw nanoscale superconducting beta-tin (beta-Sn) patterns of any shape in the plane of a topological Dirac semimetal (TDS) alpha-tin (alpha-Sn) thin film by irradiating a focused ion beam (FIB). We utilise the property that alpha-Sn undergoes a phase transition to superconducting beta-Sn upon heating by FIB. In beta-Sn nanowires embedded in a TDS alpha-Sn thin film, we observe giant non-reciprocal superconducting transport, where the critical current changes by 69% upon reversing the current direction. The superconducting diode rectification ratio reaches a maximum when the magnetic field is applied parallel to the current, distinguishing itself from all the previous reports. Moreover, it oscillates between alternate signs with increasing magnetic field strength. The angular dependence of the rectification ratio on the magnetic field and current directions is similar to that of the chiral anomaly effect in TDS alpha-Sn, suggesting that the non-reciprocal superconducting transport may occur at the beta-Sn/alpha-Sn interfaces. The ion-beam patterned Sn-based superconductor/TDS planar structures thus show promise as a universal platform for investigating novel quantum physics and devices based on topological superconducting circuits of any shape. △ Less

This inherently protected qubit paves the way to a new class of high-coherence hybrid superconducting quantum devices based on unconventional superconductors. ▽ More Van-der-Waals (vdW) assembly enables the fabrication of novel Josephson junctions utilizing an atomically sharp interface between two exfoliated and relatively twisted Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+x (Bi2212) flakes. In a range of twist angles around 45∘, the junction provides a regime where the interlayer two-Cooper pair tunneling dominates the current-phase relation. Here we propose to employ this novel junction to realize a capacitively shunted qubit that we call flowermon. The d-wave nature of the order parameter endows the flowermon with inherent protection against charge-noise-induced relaxation and quasiparticle-induced dissipation. This inherently protected qubit paves the way to a new class of high-coherence hybrid superconducting quantum devices based on unconventional superconductors. △ Less

We analyze the response up to the second order of the perturbation in the amplitude of the vector potential A⃗ , the superconducting order parameter Δ and in the third order for the current j⃗ . On the basis of this approach, we derive general expressions for the retarded (advanced) Green's functions, as well as the Keldysh function for an arbitrary number of harmonics of the incident field. Most importantly, we analyze the set of physical observables in a non-equilibrium superconductor, such as frequency and the temperature dependencies of the zero harmonic δ(Δ)0 (Eliashberg effect), the second harmonic δ(Δ)2Ω, as well as the third harmonic for the electric current j(3Ω) under the action of a monochromatic irradiation. For the same set of parameters, we also analyze the behavior of the reflectivity and the down-conversion intensity of a thin superconducting film, discussed recently in the context of parametric amplification of superconductivity. We derive these quantities microscopically and show the connection of the down-conversion intensity to the third harmonic generation currents induced by the amplitude mode and the direct action of the electric field on the charge carriers. △ Less

The temperature and excitation density dependent dynamics follow the behavior predicted by the phenomenological bottleneck model for the single-gap SC, implying adiabatic coupling between the two condensates on the ps timescale. The amplitude of the THz-driven suppression of condensate density reveals an unexpected decrease in pair-breaking efficiency with increasing temperature - unlike in the case of optical excitation. The reduced pair-breaking efficiency of narrow-band THz pulses, displaying minimum near ≈0.7 Tc, is attributed to THz-driven, long-lived, non-thermal quasiparticle distribution, resulting in Eliashberg-type enhancement of superconductivity, competing with pair-breaking. △ Less

Our density-functional theory calculations show lattice parameters and a volume contraction with x -- very similar to experiment. The DFT electronic structure shows Cu2+ in a 3d9 configuration with two extremely flat Cu bands crossing the Fermi energy. This puts Pb9Cu(PO4)6O in an ultra-correlated regime and suggests that, without doping, it is a Mott or charge transfer insulator. If doped such an electronic structure might support flat-band superconductivity or an correlation-enhanced electron-phonon mechanism, whereas a diamagnet without superconductivity appears to be rather at odds with our results. △ Less

For instance, for a 2D system with strong Rashba SOI proximity coupled to a s-wave superconductor, the in-plane magnetic field can drive the system into a gapless superconducting state while it can also induce a mirage gap at finite energies for an Ising superconductor while keeping the main gap at Fermi level intact. We show that when a s-wave superconductor proximitized to an altermagnet in the absence of SOI and in-plane magnetic field, the gapless superconducting state with mirage gap can emerge showing d-wave signature, due to the anisotropic spin splitting of the altermagnet. When the Rashba SOI is added, the system can turn into a gapped superconductor w ith mirage gap. Pairing mechanism and transport properties of mirage gap are investigated. Our result suggests that altermagnet is an ideal platform for studying gapless superconducting state and mirage gap. △ Less

Here with state-of-the-art tensor-network methods, we study a bilayer t-J-J⊥ model for La3Ni2O7 and find a robust s-wave superconductive (SC) order mediated by interlayer magnetic couplings. Large-scale density matrix renormalization group calculations find algebraic pairing correlations with Luttinger parameter of KSC≃1. Infinite projected entangled-pair state method obtains a non-zero SC order directly in the thermodynamic limit, and estimates a strong pairing strength Δ¯z∼O(0.1). Tangent-space tensor renormalization group simulations further determine a high SC temperature T∗c/J∼O(0.1) and clarify the temperature evolution of SC order. Due to the intriguing orbital selective behaviors and strong Hund's rule coupling in the compound, t-J-J⊥ model has strong interlayer spin exchange (while negligible interlayer hopping), which greatly enhances the SC pairing in the bilayer system. Such a magnetically mediated strong pairing has also been observed recently in the optical lattice of ultracold atoms. Our accurate and comprehensive tensor-network calculations reveal robust SC order in the bilayer t-J-J⊥ model and shed light on the high-Tc superconductivity in the pressurized nickelate La3Ni2O7. △ Less

    Abstract: …B magnet at room temperature, no repulsion could be felt and no magnetic levitation was observed either. These results imply that the claim of a room-temperature superconductor in modified lead-apatite may need more careful re-examination, especially for the electrical transport properties. ▽ More The very recent claim on the discovery of ambient-pressure room-temperature superconductivity in modified lead-apatite has immediately excited sensational attention in the entire society, which is fabricated by sintering lanarkite (Pb2SO5) and copper(I) phosphide (Cu3P). To verify this exciting claim, we have successfully synthesized Pb2SO5, Cu3P, and finally the modified lead-apatite Pb10−xCux(PO4)6O. Detailed electrical transport and magnetic properties of these compounds were systematically analyzed. It turns out that Pb2SO5 is a highly insulating diamagnet with a room-temperature resistivity of ~7.18x109 Ohm.cm and Cu3P is a paramagnetic metal with a room-temperature resistivity of ~5.22x10−4 Ohm.cm. In contrast to the claimed superconductivity, the resulting Pb10−xCux(PO4)6O compound sintered from Pb2SO5 and Cu3P exhibits semiconductor-like transport behavior with a large room-temperature resistivity of ~1.94x104 Ohm.cm although our compound shows greatly consistent x-ray diffraction spectrum with the previously reported structure data. In addition, when a pressed Pb10−xCux(PO4)6O pellet is located on top of a commercial Nd2Fe14B magnet at room temperature, no repulsion could be felt and no magnetic levitation was observed either. These results imply that the claim of a room-temperature superconductor in modified lead-apatite may need more careful re-examination, especially for the electrical transport properties. △ Less

It is found that addition of silicon to the V-Ti alloys results in eutectic precipitation of Ti5Si3-phase in the body centred cubic (bcc) β-V-Ti matrix. In the as-cast V0.6−xSixTi0.4 alloys, the superconducting transition temperature (TC) changes non-monotonically with increasing silicon content whereas after annealing, it is about 7.7 K for all the alloys. On the other hand, the upper critical field decreases and the coherence length increases after annealing in the x = 0.10 alloy. The variations in the superconducting properties in the alloys are related to the solubility of 6 at.% Si in the V0.60Ti0.40 alloy and the vanadium enrichment in the β matrix due to the precipitation of Ti5Si3 phase. △ Less

Our results show that superconducting fluctuations within the indium-oxide film, that proximitize the underlying metal layer, induce insulating rather than superconducting behavior. This is ascribed to suppression of density of states (due to the superconducting energy gap) for quasiparticles in the proximitized regions. Our results present a novel manifestation of the proximity effect phenomenon and provide important insight into the nature of the insulating phase of the disorder driven superconductor-insulator-transition. △ Less

Recently, 2D moiré materials have emerged as the most versatile platform for the realization of a broad range of quantum phases. These quantum phases are commonly observed at cryogenic temperatures, but a few of them exhibit sufficiently high Tc, e.g., ~ 150 K for Mott insulator states in transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) moiré interfaces. Here, we explore the origins of the stability of correlated states in WSe2/WS2 moiré superlattices by measuring the time scales of melting and their temperature dependences. Using exciton sensing and pump-probe reflectance spectroscopy, we find that ultrafast electronic excitation leads to melting of the Mott states on a time scale of 3.3 ps (at T = 11 K), which is approximately five times longer than that predicted from the charge hopping integral between moiré unit cells. We further find that the melting rates are thermally activated, with activation energies of Ea = 18 meV and 13 meV for the correlated states with one and two holes (v = -1 and -2) per moiré unit cell, respectively, suggesting significant electron-phonon coupling. The overall temperature dependences in the exciton oscillator strength, a proxy to the order parameter for the correlated states, gives estimates of Tc in agreement with the extracted Ea. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations on the moiré scale confirm polaron formation in the v = -1 Mott state and predict a hole polaron binding energy of 16 meV, in agreement with experiment. These findings suggest a close interplay of electron-electron and electron-phonon interactions in the formation of polaronic Mott insulators at TMD moiré interfaces. △ Less

With a single superconductor adjacent to the magnetic insulator this radiated electric field is totally reflected with a π-phase shift, which thereby vanishes at the superconductor side and causes no influence on the ferromagnetic resonance. When the magnetic insulator is sandwiched by two superconductors, this reflection becomes back and forth, so the electric field exists at both superconductors that drives the Meissner supercurrent, which in turn shifts efficiently the ferromagnetic resonance. We predict an ultrastrong coupling between magnons in the yttrium iron garnet and Cooper pairs in NbN with the frequency shift achieving tens of percent of the bare ferromagnetic resonance. △ Less

However, the coexistence of superconductivity and magnetism is still rare in conventional superconductors. In this work, we reported the coexistence of these two quantum orderings in high entropy carbide ceramics (Mo0.2Nb0.2Ta0.2V0.2W0.2)C0.9, (Ta0.25Ti0.25Nb0.25Zr0.25)C, and they are expected to be conventional superconductors. Clear magnetic hysteresis loop was observed in these high entropy carbides, indicating a ferromagnetic ground state. A sharp superconducting transition is observed in (Mo0.2Nb0.2Ta0.2V0.2W0.2)C0.9 with a Tc of 3.4 K and upper critical field of ~3.35 T. Meanwhile, superconductivity is suppressed to some extent and zero-resistance state disappears in (Ta0.25Ti0.25Nb0.25Zr0.25)C, in which stronger magnetism is presented. The upper critical field of (Ta0.25Ti0.25Nb0.25Zr0.25)C is only ~1.5 T, though they show higher transition temperature near 5.7 K. The ferromagnetism stems from the carbon vacancies which occurs often during the high temperature synthesis process. This work not just demonstrate the observation of superconductivity in high entropy carbide ceramics, but also provide alternative exotic platform to study the correlation between superconductivity and magnetism, and is of great benefit for the design of multifunctional electronic devices. △ Less

Specifically, there has been interest in magneto-thermal switching (MTS) materials based on superconductors, which only exhibited switching behavior when a magnetic field was applied. However, a recent report highlighted nonvolatile MTS in commercial Sn-Pb solders, attributed to magnetic flux trapping. In this study, we focused on flux trapping in a type-II superconductor MgB2. Magnetization and thermal conductivity measurements under magnetic fields were conducted on polycrystalline MgB2. We confirmed that magnetic flux was indeed trapped in MgB2 even after demagnetization. Additionally, we observed nonvolatile MTS in MgB2 as well as Sn-Pb solders. These results suggest that the nonvolatile MTS may be a widespread characteristic of superconducting materials with flux trapping. △ Less

Several assertions have already been made about room temperature superconductivity but were never verified or reproduced across the labs. The cuprates were the earliest high transition temperature superconductors, and it seems that copper has done the magic once again. Last week, a Korean group synthesized a Lead Apatite-based compound LK-99, showing a Tc of above 400∘K. The signatures of superconductivity in the compound are very promising, in terms of resistivity (R = 0) and diamagnetism at Tc. Although, the heat capacity (Cp) did not show the obvious transition at Tc. Inspired by the interesting claims of above room temperature superconductivity in LK-99, in this article, we report the synthesis of polycrystalline samples of LK-99, by following the same heat treatment as reported in [1,2] by the two-step precursor method. The phase is confirmed through X-ray diffraction (XRD) measurements, performed after each heat treatment. The room temperature diamagnetism is not evidenced by the levitation of a permanent magnet over the sample or vice versa. Further measurements for the confirmation of bulk superconductivity on variously synthesized samples are underway. Our results on the present LK-99 sample, being synthesized at 925∘C, as of now do not approve the appearance of bulk superconductivity at room temperature. Further studies with different heat treatments are though, yet underway. △ Less

The gap symmetry is crucial in understanding the underlying superconductivity mechanism. The magnitude and the phase are essential in fully characterizing the superconducting gap. Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) has played a key role in determining the gap symmetry in unconventional superconductors. However, it has been considered so far that ARPES can only measure the magnitude of the superconducting gap but not its phase; the phase has to be detected by other phase-sensitive techniques. Here we propose a new method to directly detect the superconducting gap sign by using ARPES. This method is successfully validated in a cuprate superconductor with a well-known d-wave gap symmetry. When two bands are nearby in momentum space and have a strong interband interaction, the resulted electronic structures in the superconducting state are sensitive to the relative gap sign between the two bands which can be captured by ARPES measurements. Our present work provides a new way to detect the gap sign and can be applied to various superconductors, particularly those with multiple orbitals like the iron-based superconductors. It also makes ARPES more powerful to determine both the gap magnitude and the phase that are significant in understanding the superconductivity mechanism of unconventional superconductors. △ Less

Due to the presence of macroscopic exchange field in the ferromagnet the Cooper pairs penetrating into the ferromagnet from the superconductor acquire a finite momentum there. The finite-momentum pairing manifests itself, in particular, as a nonmonotonic dependence of the critical temperature of the bilayer on the thickness of the F layer. Here we predict that despite the absence of the macroscopic exchange field the critical temperature of the antiferromagnet/superconductor (AF/S) bilayers also exhibit nonmonotonic (oscillating) dependence on the AF layer thickness. It is a manifestation of the proximity-induced Neel-type triplet correlations, which acquire finite total pair momentum and oscillate in the AF layer due to the Umklapp electron scattering processes at the AF/S interface. Our prediction can provide a possible explanation for a number of recently published experimental observations of the critical temperature of AF/S bilayers. △ Less

Demonstration of superconductivity in this material justifies the point of view that Lu plays a role of group 3 transition metal in period 6 of the Periodic table of elements. In analogy with Re0.82Nb0.18, Re6Ti, Re6Hf and Re6Zr, one can expect that crystalline Re--Lu is also breaking the time-reversal symmetry (this still waits confirmation). Magnetoresistivity and AC/DC susceptibility measurements allowed us to determine Hc1 and Hc2 of these films, as well as estimate coherence length ξ(0) and magnetic penetration depth λL(0). We also provide information on surface morphology of these films. △ Less

    Abstract: …However, the observation of spin-direction rotation occurring inside the SC state (SC spin rotation) has hardly been reported. UTe2, a recently discovered topological superconductor, exhibits various SC phases under pressure: SC state at ambient pressure (SC1), high-temperature SC state above 0.5 GPa (SC2), and low-temperature SC state above 0.5 GPa (SC3).… ▽ More Superconducting (SC) state has spin and orbital degrees of freedom, and spin-triplet superconductivity shows multiple SC phases due to the presence of these degrees of freedom. However, the observation of spin-direction rotation occurring inside the SC state (SC spin rotation) has hardly been reported. UTe2, a recently discovered topological superconductor, exhibits various SC phases under pressure: SC state at ambient pressure (SC1), high-temperature SC state above 0.5 GPa (SC2), and low-temperature SC state above 0.5 GPa (SC3). We performed nuclear magnetic resonance and AC susceptibility measurements on single-crystal UTe2. The b-axis spin susceptibility remains unchanged in SC2, unlike in SC1, and decreases below the SC2-SC3 transition with spin modulation. These unique properties in SC3 arise from the coexistence of two SC order parameters. Our NMR results confirm the spin-triplet superconductivity with SC spin parallel to b in SC2, and unveil the remaining of spin degrees of freedom in superconducting UTe2. △ Less

Here, we study two different power supply systems. The first, a conventional one, consists of a transformer and a diode bridge operating at room temperature, plus current leads that allow the current to flow from the room-temperature medium to the cryogenic medium. The second consists of a transformer with a superconducting secondary winding, combined with a diode bridge operating at cryogenic temperature, thus dispensing with the need for current leads. We are experimentally comparing the performance of conventional and superconducting transformers, as well as the performance of a diode bridge at ambient and cryogenic temperatures. Our results indicate that the prototype superconducting transformer developed has lower winding resistance and secondary leakage inductance than the conventional transformer. In addition, we found that only certain diodes are suitable for operation at cryogenic temperatures. Finally, the diode bridge made from adapted diodes shows reduced losses at cryogenic temperature. This experimental work is the first step towards the realization of a complete power supply system for a superconducting device. △ Less
