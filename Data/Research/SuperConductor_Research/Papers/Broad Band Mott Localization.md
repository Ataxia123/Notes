A hypothetical non-dimerized Cu chain in equilibrium is a spin- 1
2
atom Mott insulator (AMI),
eventhough its band width is high ∼ 10 eV. This RVB reservoir has a large exchange coupling J
∼ 2 eV. This idea of, broad band Mott localization was used by us in our earlier works, including
prediction of high Tc superconductivity in doped graphene, silicene and a theory for hot superconductivity reported in Ag-Au nanostructures (TP 2008). In the present work we identify possible
random AMI subsystems in Cu-Pb10(PO4)6O and develop a model for reported hot superconductivity (LKK 2023). In apatite structure, network of interstitial columnar spaces run parallel to
c-axis and ab-plane. They accomodate excess copper, as Cu0
clusters, chains and planar segments.
They are our emergent AMI’s. Electron transfer from AMI’s to insulating host, generates strong
local superconducting correlation, via phyics of doped Mott insulator. Josephson coupling between
doped AMI’s, establishes hot superconductivity. A major Challenge to superconducting order in
real material is competing insulating phases - valence bond solid (spin-Peirels)-lattice distortions
etc. AMI theory points to ways of making the elusive superconductivity palpable. We recommend
exploration of hot superconductivity in the rich world of minerals and insulators, via metal atom
inclusion.
INTRODUCTION
A milestone discovery of high Tc superconductivity in
cuprates, by Bednorz and Muller [1] in 1986 heralded serious attempts to discover new superconductors, possibly
with higher Tc’s. Resonating valence bond theory of high
Tc superconductivity, a response to understand cuprates,
pioneered by Anderson [2–7] created a fertile ground for
new physics, variety of quantum spin liquids [8, 9] etc.
Doped spin- 1
2 Mott insulators became a playground for
high Tc superconductivity and offered new hope, inspite
of competing orders [10].
Announcement of hot superconductivity in certain hydrides [11, 12], Ag-Au nanostrucutes [13] and more recently, Cu-Pb10(PO4)6O [14] has excited the community.
Historically there have been claims of hot superconductivity, named unstable and elusive superconductors[15].
In the past, inspired by possibility of broad band Mott
localization we have developed theories of superconductivity in doped graphene-graphite [16–18], silicene [19],
B doped diamond [20], K3 p-Terphenyl [21], Hydride [22]
and Ag-Au nanostructures [23, 24]. Here atom Mott insulators (AMI)and near Mott localization in low dimensional monoatom assemblies play special role.
In what follows, we propose a model for possibile hot
superconductivity in Cu-Pb10(PO4)6O system, based on
our AMI theory [23, 24] applied to reported superconductivity in Ag-Au nanostructures. Our arguments are
rather qualitative. However, they enumerate rich possibilities, likely to have implications for future studies.
In Pb10(PO4)6O , interstitial sites of Pb octahedral
columns are half empty. In addition, a network of c-axis
interstitial columns and ab-plane interstital columns are
present in the ionic-covalent insulating matrix. Our hypothesis is that excess Cu gets accommodated as a random network of weakly connected clusters, chains and
2D patches of Cu0
in the network of interstitial columns.
These are the weakly coupled random network of emergent AMI’s
Difference in electronegativity induces electron transfer from Mott insulating Cu0 AMI subsystem to the host
insulator. It is a good assumption that transferred electrons get localized in the random envoronment of the
disturbed host. A random network of hole doped Mott
insulator emerges. In doped Mott insulator, resonating singlets generate strong Cooper pair correlation. In
the pair tunneling mechanism of superconductivity [25],
because of spin-charge decoupling present in the Hubbard chains, single electron tunneling between chains is
blocked at low energy scales. However, pair tunneling is
not blocked. This Josephson type pair tunneling selfconsistently builds a 3D superconducting state[25, 26].
This weakly coupled doped reference Mott insulator,
a coupled t-J model of chains and clusters explains observed hot superconductivity, for our estimates of model
parameter for Cu-Pb apatite. A major Challenge to our
mechanism of superconductivity is competing (insulating) orders such as valence bond solid (spin-Peirels) and
structural distortions, within AMI subsystem.
Interestingly anomalous diamagnetism and ferromagnetism at room temperatures have been reported in
monoatomic Cu, Ag and Au nonosystems [27–33] This
underscores importance of electron electron Coulomb interaction effects in broad band monovalent atom systems
in low dimensions.
In the present paper we focuss on possible doped Mott
insulator physics that has proven validity in the context
of single band system such as cuprates and other strongly
correlated superconductors, consistent with our earlier
proposal of ‘Five fold way to new superconductors’ [10]
2
and emergent Mott insulators in effectively atomic Mott
systems [16, 18–21].
Our article is organized as follows. First we present
arguments for how isolated bare narrow bands (for example in the Cu2+ substitution scenerio) will not give
us scale of Tc reported and a need for broad band Mott
localization. After a summary of phenomenology of superconducting Cu-Pb Apatite, we present a structuralelectronic model for Cu subsystem in Cu-Pb Apatite.
Emergence of weakly coupled effectively Mott insulating
cluster, chains and patches of Cu0 AMI’s is presented
(4s orbital are weakly hybridized with orbitals of surrounding ions). Then we present inter cluster, chain,
2D patches pair tunneling mechanism, coupled t-J chain
model relevant for weakly coupled doped Mott insulating chains and estimates of superconducting Tc’s. Obstacles to reach hot superconductivity, via competing orders
prevalent in low dimensional Mott insulating systems and
electron lattice coupling is discussed next.
WHY BROAD BAND MOTT LOCALIZATION ?
Many mechanisms for high Tc superconductivity exists. One of them is the doped spin- 1
2 Mott insulator,
RVB mechanism. In this route an effective single band
close to half filling plays a key role. Known doped Mott
insulators, for example high Tc cuprates have a bare band
width of about 2 eV and singlet exchange coupling is
about 0.15 eV. Maximum Tc possible in cuprate system
(from theory point of view) is about 200 K - it is never
realized in practice, because of unavoidable competing orders. In organic superconductors (which could be viewed
as self doped Mott insulators) bands are about 0.5 eV
wide; experimentlly seen maximum Tc is about 12 K.
In cuprates the physics is not one of emergence of heavy
quasiparticles at the Fermi leve, but that of celebrated
spin-charge decoupling, failure of Fermi liquid state and
absence of Fermi liquid quasi particles at the Fermi level.
It is interesting to recall emergence of heavy effective
mass of Fermi liquid quaiparticles and an emergent flat
band at the Fermi level in heavy Fermions. Here bare
band width of conduction electrons is very wide. However, Kondo exchange with localized spins generates, at
low energy scale an effective narrow quasi particle band
(built out of Kondo resonances) at the Fermi level. This
strongly correlated state has superconductivity. However, scale of Tc is limited by Kondo temperature in an
exponential fashion.
If one assumes, as the authors of LK-99 have suggested,
replacement of one chain of Pb2+ by Cu2+ , one should
get a narrow and isolated bare half filled band at the
Fermi level. This is because of large Cu-Cu separation,
and an unfriendly envoronment (as explained below)for
Cu2+ . Conequently, as recent ab-initio calculations [34]
show, one gets isolated bare narrow bands. Correlation
effects will further narrow the band. When we estimate
Tc, using doped Mott insulator physics, we get a Tc not
exceeding 10K. Even this Tc will be reduced further by
disorder effects and singlet localization via lattice distortion.
So we are forced to think about an alternative. Here,
broad band Mott localization comes in handy and could
push Tc’s to the scales observed.
SUPERCONDUCTING PHENOMENOLOGY OF
LK99
Pb10(PO4)6O , an ionic insulator is a member of a large
family of apatite minerals, with a nominal charge state
Pb2+
10 (PO4)
3−
6 O2−. The authors [14] state that replacement of about a tenth of Pb2+ ions by Cu2+ ions results
in an insulator to metal transition. They report Meissner
signal, vanishing resistivity, levitation. and Tc exceeding
400 K. It is important to point out that their structural
analysis using XRays, shows a minor phase of Cu2S. Defect concentrations, nature of structural irregularies, size
of crystallites are not reported.
They also sketch a mechanism of superconductivity
based on substitution of Pb2+ by Cu2+ in the c-axis
chains of Pb. Very recent ab-initio calculation[34] shows
presence of well isolated narrow 3d band of Cu2+ . In
our estimate the entire isolated band is too narrow and
could support only very low Tc superconductivity, via
Mott localization physics, as briefly explained in the next
section.
Recent works [35, 36] report succesfull synthesis of
LK99; their search for superconductivity continues.
A STRUCTURAL MODEL AND REFERENCE
ELECTRONIC STATE FOR LK99
What are the charge state of added Cu in LK-99 ?
In general, local solid state and quantum chemistry and
energetics dictate stable and possible metastable charge
states of added atom. Cu is known to become Cu2+ ion,
when there is covalent mixing with oxygen atoms, as in
copper complexes, solid CuSO4, CuO and cuprates.
Cu2+ in principle can replace Pb2+ in the Pb chain.
However, the trigonal prismatic local envoronment provided by corners of 6 surround phosphate tetrahedra, is
not conducive for Cu2+ ion replacement. Ionization energy of 4s electron of Cu is high, about 7.7 eV. It is
also likely that lone pair electrons of Pb2+ has an important role in not selecting Cu2+ state. When one replaces Pb2+ ions by Cu2+ , according to very recent
ab-initio studies [34] one gets narrow and well isolated
Cu 3d band at the Fermi velvel (even without correlation effects). As mentioned earlier superconducting Tc’s
given by electronic mechanism in this bare and isolated
narrow band is very small.
In what follows we present possibility of excess Cu
atoms getting accommodated as clusters, chains and 2D
3
patches of Cu0 and becoming a source of atom Mott insulator (AMI) and broad band Mott localization. To
appreciate this, we discuss the structure first. Apatite
minerals have complex structures and large unit cells.
Nature has used millions of years to arrive at a pretty
periodic structure in Pb10(PO4)6O .
Pairs of (PO4)
3− tetrahedra stack to form columns,
which run parallel to c-axis and form a Kagome lattice.
Pb2+ ions create c-axis chains and form a hexagonal
lattice. Pb2+
6
octahedra share faces and create c-axis
columns of triangular lattice. Half of the interstitial sies
of the octahedra are occupied by O2− ions. (Triangular
and Kagome lattices are formed respectively by centers of
elementary hexagon and centers of nearest neighbor bond
of honeycomb lattice). Asymmetric pairing of Phosphate
tetrahedra adds possibility of chirality orders in apatite.
The half empty interstitials in Pb octahedral columns
in real systems are likely to have disordered O2− occupantion, leaving pieces of empty interstitial columns. In
addition network of c-axis interstitial columns and abplane interstital columns are present in the ionic-covalent
netowrk. Further minerals, including apatites with tetrahedral moieties are known to be good ionic (for example O2−) conductors [37]. Since ionic radii of O2− ion
Cu0 are very close, we expect our proposed channel network to accomodate Cu0 atoms.
Our hypothesis is that excess Cu gets accommodated
as a random network of clusters, chains and 2D patches
of Cu0
. In what follows we discuss how the Cu0 network
becomes reservoirs of resonating and strong singlets, via
broad band Mott localization.
EMERGENCE OF SINGLET RESERVOIRS IN
Cu0 SUBSYSTEM
Monovalent metals are special - they are half filled,
very broad tight binding bands made of s like Wannier orbitals. Copper in bulk is a broad band 4s metal, well described by a half filled band of repulsive Hubbard model.
However, 3 dimensionality makes Hubbard repulsive U
irrelevant at low energy scales. A robust Fermi liquid
state (which resits superconductivity, even at the lowest temperatures) wins and we get a jellium metal. Any
electron correlation effects go off the energy shell [23, 24]
What is fascinating is that in low, namely zero and
one dimensions low energy physics changes qualitatively
and gives way to broad band Mott localization.
Nano Clusters of Cu0 as Singlet Reservoirs
Let us consider zero dimensions or small clusters of
monovalent atoms for emergent strong pairing correlations. Monovalent metal atom clusters have been extensively studied from the point of view of electron correlation effects and magnetism, using Hubbard model for
example [38–44]. Nearest neighbor hoping t ≈ 3 eV and
onsite repulsion U ≈ 7. For example Cu2 exists as a stable molecule in free space as a tightly bound spin singlet
with a binding energy of ≈ 2 eV.
In small Cu clusters, large antiferromagnetic exchange
J ∼ 2 eV gives rise to strong singlet bonds and resonances. In comparison to cuprates, where J ≈ 0.15 eV,
we have an order of magnitude larger singlet pairing energy scale. Consequently local pairing temperature scale
we get, on doping are several hundreds of Kelvin.
Effective Hamiltonian for a monovalent atom cluster is
the Heisenberg antiferromagnetic Hamiltonian:

), (d’s are electron operators)
to emphasize the fact that strongly coupled bond singlets
are natural basic units (rather than spin moments) in
clusters. It is the resonance of these bond singlets (metal
cluster aromaticity) which is at the heart of our mechanism for superconductivity. More importantly resonance
energies of bond singlets are comparable to cohesion energy of monovalent clusters [40].
Consider a simple tetrahedral cluster, an elementary
closely packed unit in fcc lattice. Two singlets resonate
and stabilize a singlet ground state. Larger clusters have
been studied from the point of view of equilibrium shapes
of clusters. For us what is important is the singlet content
and their resonance. The tetrahedral RVB system has a
doubly degenerate singlet ground state. The symmetric
tetrahedra distorts via valence bond localization - this is
an analogue of spin-Peierls distortion in the finite cluster.
We have suggested presence of a distribution of clusters
in Cu Pb Apatite. As we go to larger clusters there are
more complex resonances, depending on size and shape
of a cluster. Singlets and their resonances continue to be
present till a critical size. Beyond the critical size singlets and their resonances go off the energy shell [23, 24]
and the bulk of the cluster behaves as a jellium metal
(filled shells) at low energies. Surfaces of larger clusters
are likely to have interesting singlet correlations and resonances.
It is clear that small clusters of various kinds are
important as singlet reservoirs, as they provide a large
singlet pairing energy scale J ≈ 2 eV.
Cu0 Chains as Singlet Reservoirs
In an ideal Cu chain in equilibrium, without dimerization, half filled band of 4s electrons get Mott localized [45–47], as a consequence of low dimensionality, even
though the band is broad (∼ 8 eV wide) band. This spinhalf Mott insulating chain becomes a reservoir of resonating singlets and large exchange energy scale J ∼ 2 eV. If
we ignore lattice dimerazation instabilities, 1D Hubbard
model predicts a Mott insulator with a Mott Hubbard
gap of ∼ 1 eV (Lieb and Wu [45]) and superexchange J
4
∼ 2 eV for Cu. Effective Hamiltonian of neutral Cu chain
is given by an antiferromagnetic Heisenberg Hamiltonian
similar to equation 1.
When we move away from half filling we get, Luttinger
liquid with spin-charge decoupling, enhanced local pairing and a very large fluctuationg pairing gap in ideal
doped Cu chains. An organization of Cu chains into
weakly interacting chain and doping easily brings in ambient Tc superconductivity as discussed below.
For illustration, consider a 2D array of weakly coupled
(for a range of interchain hopping t⊥) Cu chains. To
avoid competing antiferromagnetic 2 sublattice order, we
stagger the chains, so that when t⊥ = t we get isotropic
triangular lattice. Using known studies we find doped
Mott insulator physics and ambient Tc superconductivity, provided competing instabilities such as dimerization
and valence bond order are taken care of.
In the above system pair tunneling plays an important role in stabilizing 2D or 3D superconducting order.
We have used Wheatley-Hsu-Anderson’s mechanism [25]
of interlayer pair tunneling and similar interchain pair
tunneling theory of Zachar, Kivelson and Emery [26] to
estimate superconducting Tc’s.
Scale of Tc is given by kBTc ≈ t
2
⊥/∆s. Here ∆s
is a local spin gap scale. It can be approximated by
superexchange J, in the present context. It is easily seen
that for reasonable choice of t⊥, in our model system of
Ag and Au we get 2D superconducting Tc at ambient
temperature scales. Thus we conclude that nanoscale
Cu segments are also important singlet reservoirs, with
a high pairing temperature scale.
2D Planar Cu0 net as Singlet Reservoirs
Two dimensions is equally interesting. We considered
hypothetical 2D triangular lattices of Cu. Firstly, U is
not strong enough to result in Mott localization. However, a form of (self) doped Mott insulator physics (dynamical Mott localization) survives at and close to half
filling. Using results from existing body of literature [48–
54] we have estimated the Tc. After doping, results for
Tc are not very different for triangular lattice and square
lattice, even though symmetry of order parameters are
different (d-wave for square lattice[5], and d + id for triangular lattice and honeycomb lattices [17, 55]).
Interestingly, in these model studies kBTc is a finite
fraction of hoping parameter t, even for intermediate repulsions. In view of this non-BCS dependence we obtain
ambient temperature (and higher) pairing temperature
scales for Cu subsystem at and close to half filling.
What is important for LK99 is that the nanoscale 2D
patches will support strong singlet pairing, which could
eventually contribute to observed 3D hot Tc granular
superconductivity.
RANDOMLY COUPLED CHARGED AMI’S AND
EMERGENCE OF GRANULAR
SUPERCONDUCTIVITY
As we mentioned earlier, weakly coupled reservoir of
neutral singlets (clusters, chand and 2D patches) could
transfer a fraction of 4s valence electrons to the insulating
host. Transferred electrons will in general get trapped
and become immobile, via disorder and correlation effects. In the charged AMI’s resonating neutral singlets
become charged Cooper pairs and get delocalized within
the cluster, via physics of doped Mott insulator. Our
clusters and chains, become Cooper pair boxes and are
ready for Josephson coupling with neighbors.
We have a model of randomly Josephson coupled
Cooper pair boxes. In view of the strong local pairing
scale, our estimate of superconducting Tc easily reach
ambient temperature superconducting scales. We hope
to discuss details in a later article.
COMPETING ORDERS
Competing orders are ubiquitous in strongly correlated
electron systems such as cuprates. These orders are typically charge and spin stripe orders accompanied by strong
lattice distortions. Competing orders are encouraged
when one has certain structural chemistry. For example, in LSCO, a monolayer cuprate, octahedral rotation
strongly encourages stripe order and superconducting Tc
comes down close to 30 K. Whereas in YBCO, a bilayer
cuprate, the bilayer nature prevents easy octahedral rotation and Tc is more than 90 K. Trilayer cuprates, the
middle layers are protected from competing orders and
Tc’s exceed 120 K.
In clusters and chains there is a strong tendency for
dimerization type of instability. In chain it is the spinPeierls (valence bond) order accommanied by lattice
dimerization
It was our prediction [24] that monovalent single layer
atomic net is a potential hot superconductor. We also
emphasize that in real 2D monoatomic monovalent metal
system [56], when synthesized, competing orders such as
valence bond order and lattice dimerization will compete
and supress superconductivity. Free hanging 2D layers
are good bet, as they are not influenced by 2D layer
grown on substrates.
A deeper understanding of structural chemistry will
enable structural design with reduced competing order.
DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION
Excited by the report of observation of hot superconductivity in the Cu-Pb Apatite system, we have presented a couple of scenarios, keeping solid state and quantum chemical constraints in mind and suggested possibility of hot superconductivity via electronic mechanism of
5
doped Spin 1
2 Mott insulator, utilizing broad band Mott
localization.
Our theory makes use of doped spin- 1
2
doped Mott
insulator route to superconductivity, with the emphasis
on the fact that monovalent metal atoms under suitable
conditions (such as reduced dimensions) readily undergo
Mott localization. Over years we have used this AMI
idea to develop tangible models to understand superconductivity in complex solid state systems such as hydrides,
K3p-Terphenyl, B-doped diamond and Ag-Au nanostructures, doped graphene and silicene.
In the present article we have proposed a compelling
scenario, without full justification from quantum chemical calculations etc. In the same spirit, we briefly discuss
possibility of a related, but somewhat different scenario.
Here Cu atom get accommodated as a neutral impurity
and creates an s-like donor impurity state in the band
gap of Pb10(PO4)6O . As impurity concentration is increased impurity state wave functin will overlap and we
could have a Anderson-Mott insulator to superconductor
transition, as outlined in our theory for B doped diamond [20]. Here also, depending on the binding energy
of the donor state we could in principle get Tc reaching
the scales claimed.
As a key idea and notion, superconductivity in doped
Mott insulators began while attempting to understand
high Tc cuprates by Anderson in 1987. It is becoming
increasingly clear that this idea has a wide applicability.
We once again emphasize, excited by our theory, experimental exploration of the rich field of low dimensional
monovalent metals, monovalent metal doped minerals,
insulators and in metallurgy, where variety of nanostructures are norm of the day.
We also wish to reiterate that while Cu2+ doping is an
attractive idea, correponding isolated bare band widths
are so low that Cooper pairs will get localized strongly by
lattice distortion and disorder. For the scale of reported
Tc, we need broad band Mott localization emphasized in
the present article, rather than narrow band Mott localization. It is important to recall that even in high Tc
cuprates an effective single band (which is not isolated)
width is of the order of 2 eV, which is capable of giving
superconductivity. at temperatures close to 100 K.
Our broad band Mott localization and AMI is likely
to play a key role in other systems perhaps. We conclude our article by reproducing a paragraph from our
2019 arXiv article on broad band Mott localization and
emergent AMI (reference [23], page 6, 2nd column, 3rd
paragraph in discussion session):
‘Does ambient temperature granular superconductivity
exist already, in some form or other, in the rich world of
minerology and metallurgy - natural ones and man made
? An exploration into minerology and metallurgy is likely
to offer surprises’.

P.W. Anderson showed us a fertile direction to achieve
hot supercondtivity. A phenomenologist par excellence,
who listened to nature always, Phil was skeptical about
existence of hot superconductors, before cuprates. In
his article [57] Superconductivity in the Past and Future
(1969) he states, ‘Room-temperature magnets or superconducting skis ? Probably not. For one thing, so many
diverse types of materials exist in nature or have been
made in the laboratory that large, obvious effects would
probably already have been seen. But room-temperature
interferometers ? Who knows ?’
My obsession with possible hot superconductivity, via
broad band Mott localization, ever since I got entangled with RVB theory from January 1987, did bring constant appreciation from Phil. I dedicate this article to
the memory of P.W. Anderson, my mentor, whose 100th
birth anniversary is on the horizon.
