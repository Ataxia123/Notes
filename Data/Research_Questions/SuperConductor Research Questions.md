>[!cue] GPT Response


To study high-temperature superconductivity, the following  data aggregation would be useful:

1. Historical Data: This includes the timeline of discoveries related to superconductivity, the researchers involved, and the breakthroughs they made. 

2. Material Data: Information about the different materials that exhibit high-temperature superconductivity, such as copper oxides, ceramics, and certain metals. This should include their properties, manufacturing processes, and challenges in their use.

3. Temperature Data: Data on the critical temperatures at which different materials become superconductors, and how these temperatures compare to absolute zero, room temperature, and the boiling points of different substances (like liquid nitrogen).

4. Theoretical Models: Information on the different theories proposed to explain high-temperature superconductivity, such as the resonating valence bond theory and the role of d-wave pairing.

5. Practical Applications: Data on how high-temperature superconductors are used in real-world applications, such as in superconducting
