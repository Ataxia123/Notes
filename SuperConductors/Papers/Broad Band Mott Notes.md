Main Notes:
- Broad Band Mott Localization is a theory used to explain hot superconductivity.
- The theory was applied to the study of Cu-Pb10(PO4)6O, a hypothetical non-dimerized Cu chain in equilibrium.
- The theory suggests that electron transfer from Atom Mott Insulators ([[AMI]]) to the insulating host generates strong local superconducting correlation.
- The theory also suggests that [[Josephson coupling]] between doped AMI's establishes hot superconductivity.
- The theory was used in earlier works to predict high Tc superconductivity in doped graphene, silicene, and Ag-Au nanostructures.
- The theory points to ways of making elusive superconductivity palpable and recommends exploration of hot superconductivity in the world of minerals and insulators.

Summary:
Broad Band Mott Localization is a theory that has been used to explain hot superconductivity in various materials. It suggests that electron transfer from Atom Mott Insulators (AMI) to the insulating host can generate strong local superconducting correlation, and that Josephson coupling between doped AMI's can establish hot superconductivity. The theory has been used to predict high Tc superconductivity in doped graphene, silicene, and Ag-Au nanostructures, and it points to ways of making elusive superconductivity palpable. The theory recommends further exploration of hot superconductivity in the world of minerals and insulators.
