>[!notice] Hey there, welcome to our /SuperConductors/ community! We're a bunch of superconductor enthusiasts, researchers, and curious minds, all working together to unravel the mysteries of superconductivity.

[[Superconductivity 101]]
[[Superconductivity 101 Syllabus]]

Our [[SuperConductors]] section is like a treasure trove of knowledge. It's divided into a few key areas. [[Current State of Affairs]] is where we keep up-to-date with the latest and greatest in superconductor research. It's like our newsroom, buzzing with the latest findings, breakthroughs, and even the challenges we're facing.

Then there's the [[ResearchQuestions]] section. This is where we brainstorm, ask questions, and identify new areas we want to explore. It's like our think tank, where we push the boundaries of what we know about superconductors.

We've also got a [[Coordination Hub]]  with a Links to Places section, which is like our library. It's packed with resources, from full research papers to protocols and even links to our fundraising efforts. It's also home to our online hub that provides a summary of the LK-99 superconductor, a real game-changer in the field of superconductivity.

>[!notice] ## Now, you might be wondering, "How can I help improve this knowledge base?" Well, there are quite a few ways you can contribute:

**Stay Current**: The world of superconductors is always evolving. If you come across new research or findings, share it with us! We're all about keeping our [[Current State of Affairs|Current State of Affairs]] section up-to-date.

Ask Questions: Got a burning question or a new idea? Add it to our [[ResearchQuestions]]'section. Your curiosity could spark a whole new area of exploration!

Share Resources: If you stumble upon a useful article, research paper, or online forum, add it to our '[[Coordination Hub]] Links to Places' section. The more resources we have, the better
we can understand and advance in the field of superconductors.

Organize and Structure: If you have a knack for organizing, consider helping us structure the information in a more user-friendly way. Maybe we could create new subsections for different types of superconductors or different aspects of superconductor research.

Join the Conversation: We're a community, and every voice matters. Share your insights, ask questions, debate theories - every contribution helps enrich our collective understanding. [[Chat Links]]

Visualize: If you're good with visuals, consider creating diagrams, infographics, or other visual aids to help explain complex concepts. A picture is worth a thousand words, after all!

Remember, we're all here to learn, explore, and push the boundaries of what we know about superconductors. Every contribution, no matter how small, helps us get one step closer to our goal. So, dive in, explore, and let's make some breakthroughs together!

## The Benefits of Open Source Science

1. **Collaboration and Resource Sharing:** Open source science allows researchers from around the world to collaborate on projects. This can lead to more comprehensive and diverse research outcomes. It also allows for resource sharing, which can optimize work processes and reduce duplication of effort.

2. **Transparency and Reproducibility:** Open source science promotes transparency in research, as all data, methodologies, and findings are openly available. This transparency allows other researchers to reproduce and verify the results, enhancing the reliability and credibility of the research.

3. **Accelerated Innovation:** By making research findings openly available, open source science can accelerate innovation. Other researchers can build upon the existing research, leading to new discoveries and advancements in the field.

4. **Education and Skill Development:** Open source projects provide a platform for learning and skill development. Contributors can learn from each other, gain experience in new tools and technologies, and improve their problem-solving and collaboration skills.

5. **Democratization of Knowledge:** Open source science promotes the democratization of knowledge by making scientific research accessible to everyone, regardless of their location or resources. This can help to reduce inequalities in access to scientific knowledge and promote a more inclusive scientific community.

6. **Sustainability and Funding:** Open source projects can explore innovative funding models, such as crowdfunding or project-specific cryptocurrencies. This can provide a sustainable source of funding for the project and incentivize contributions.

By integrating open source principles into scientific research, we can foster a more collaborative, transparent, and innovative scientific community.

**Based on the research on #SuperConductors, the following improvements and expansions can be proposed for the Coordination Hub:**

[[Knowledge Repository:]] Create a centralized knowledge repository where all research findings, data, and insights related to the #SuperConductors project can be stored and accessed by all team members. This could be facilitated by the LK99 knowledge graph and the DeSci LK99 Github repo. 

[[Collaboration Tools]]: Implement collaboration tools that allow for real-time communication and collaboration among team members. This could include video conferencing tools, shared document editing platforms, and project management software.

[[Training and Workshops]]: Organize regular training sessions and workshops to ensure all team members are up-to-date with the latest research findings and methodologies related to #SuperConductors. This could be facilitated by the workshop drafted by @At0xNQ and @JBate7.

[[Partnerships]]: Establish partnerships with other research institutions, industry players, and potential funders. This could be facilitated by the outreach efforts of Jelani and Josh.

[[Public Engagement]]: Increase efforts to engage with the public and other stakeholders. This could include writing engaging pieces about the project, presenting at conferences, and organizing public talks and discussions.

Goal: 
- Create a LK99 knowledge graph to facilitate the coordination of efforts in pushing said research forward.
- leverage Obsidian.md + Carlosâ€™ AI embeds to visual and establish said coordination graph. (May have potential synergies with Lateral.io)
- Create a DeSci LK99 github repo that will underlie the DeSci LK99 obsidian.md graph.
    - it will be the place where groups push their respective notes too which will then feed the consolidate DeSci LK99 graph

DSW Tasks:
- Create Github repo to consolidate that the groups can push their LK99 notes to (Carolina)
- Create a DSW Obsidian.md 
- Reach out to Lateral.io and see if they would like to come on board (Jelani)
- Draft a workshop to explain to the research groups how they can contribute their notes ( @At0xNQ @JBate7 )
- Write a short but engaging piece on what we are doing here as a CTA to draw more interest.
- Reach out to and share the write up with Eiri and other players potentially interested in contributing (Jelani, Josh, etc)
