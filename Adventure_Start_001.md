Alright, let's begin our adventure. You are all gathered in the city of Neverwinter when your old friend, the dwarf Gundren Rockseeker, hires you to escort a wagon to Phandalin. Gundren has gone ahead with his warrior escort, a fierce human named Sildar Hallwinter, to attend to business in the town while you follow with the supplies.

You've spent the last few days following the High Road south from Neverwinter, and you've just veered east along the Triboar Trail. You've encountered no trouble so far, but this territory can be dangerous. Bandits and outlaws have been known to lurk along the trail.

As you're traveling, up ahead, you spot two dead horses sprawled in the middle of the path, each has several black-feathered arrows sticking out from it. The woods press in close to the trail here, with a steep embankment and dense thickets on either side.

What do you do?
