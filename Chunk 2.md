While this prospect is exciting, it also raises important questions related to our personal and societal identities, as well as our relationship with technology and the physical world. As we continue down this path, it will be important to consider the potential risks and benefits of these emerging technologies and to shape their development in ways that promote positive outcomes for individuals and society as a whole.

Whether the creation of an embodied internet - a metaverse if you will - is a tremendous boon for humanity or a horrible curse will largely depend on the shape it takes. The metaverse and its related future iterations of the internet promises to open up a wide spectrum of potential futures. In its most positive versions, blockchain technology and the metaverse will empower individuals, boost meaningful human connection, and expand valuable economic activity. The metaverse can be shaped to function as a powerful equalizer, providing boundless opportunities for those from disadvantaged social, economic, and geographic backgrounds.

However, in its most negative incarnations, blockchains and the metaverse can become powerful tools for digital surveillance and societal control, governed by a single, unaccountable entity like Facebook or the Chinese Communist Party.

The range of possible futures is vast and between these extremes lie innumerable other paths that will either help to unite humanity and give it purpose or serve as the most seductive form of digital opium ever invented - helping to distract us from the problems of the real world.

Ultimately, the future of the metaverse is in the hands of the committed few - users, builders, and investors actively exploring this technology. Our actions, whether it be the platforms we choose to use, the projects and technologies we invest our time in developing, or the businesses we support financially, will shape the future direction of this technology. We have the power to vote with our time, attention, and money, and the choices we make will determine the future trajectory of the metaverse. However, many of the votes we make occur unconsciously. When we choose to buy an NFT or play a video game, we are not thinking about how that action constitutes a vote for a certain type of digital future. How then can we coordinate and exert the magnitude of intentional effort we will need to manifest a beneficial metaverse? Herein lies the value of stories.

Ideas and narratives have always been powerful tools for shaping our individual and collective future. From early science fiction depictions of cyberspace and the metaverse to today's rapidly evolving blockchain and NFT spaces, the stories we tell about technology shape our interaction with that technology as well as our understanding of what is possible and what we can achieve. It's crucial to critically examine the narratives that dominate these spaces and ensure that they align with the principles of decentralization, distributed ownership and community control that underpin them. By being conscious of the stories we tell and actively shaping them to align with our values, we can create a more intentional and positive future for the metaverse.
