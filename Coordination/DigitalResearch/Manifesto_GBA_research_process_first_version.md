Where:
DAO driven deployment of project repository is a function which irreversibly creates the on-chain data structure allowing standard Git operations (repository), with access level control based on the corresponded DAO rules (decentralized management),
DAO driven deployment/updating of proposals is a function which irreversibly creates the on-chain data structure representing scientific research proposal, with access level control based on the corresponded DAO rules (decentralized management), and updatability in persistent manner (saving all the intermediate versions),
DAO driven Soft Majority Voting is a function which allows to quantitatively vote for/against the proposal with alignment to SMV algorithm (described in Supplementary material 2),
DAO driven Soft Cooperative Voting is a function which allows to quantitatively allocate tokenized funds for the proposal with alignment to SCV algorithm (described in Supplementary material 3),
Branching/committing is the on-chain functions corresponding to standard Git operations (described in Supplementary material 4),
Rejection is a proposal status which can occur when SMV procedure gives negative result or SCV procedure gives an amount lower than a threshold,
Research Loop reflects the principles of limitless knowledge extraction, stating that every research process has no-limit unless meritocracy willingness or resources shortage happen. 

Researcher suggests reproducible approach of each quantitative thesis as a result.

This approach must correspond to the 5 R principle: (1) is relevant to stakeholders; (2) is rapid and recursive in application; (3) redefines rigor; (4) reports on resources required; and (5) is replicable.

Chapter 1. Proposal & Assessment

Research proposal basically consists of:

The goal of research,
Research methodology,
Reasoning of the methodology applicability, adjusted by theoretical basis & empirical practices,
Qualitative & quantitative criteria of the results evaluation,
Social implication, scientific impact, legal issues, industrial impact,
Addressing the first four of 5 R principles of research study.

From the blockchain and IT infrastructure perspective, research proposals can be considered as a tree-like structure with branching state depending on repeated revisions.

With each proposal revision there are:

Subject to accept (with mandatory comments to proceed on the next branch),
Subject to reject (with mandatory comments to proceed on the next branch),
Each proposal is also subject to be finally accepted or finally rejected with a certain number of iterations,
If proposal being accepted, this event automatically triggered the next stage of execution

Chapter 2. Execution

We are aware that the execution process highly depends on the science area & type of research (see Supplementary materials 1). 

Nevertheless, we suggest the following principles to be applied to any research execution process.

Research process must be consistent to the proposed methodology unless the intermediate stage researcher reveals that the methodology could not lead to the proposed results.

In the latter, a researcher who is a goodwiller publicly announces that by creating corresponding denial of research proposals. For that purpose he suggests a deep analysis of the proposal denial.

Denial of research proposal as a common proposal also is a subject of voting procedure.

Any rejection of a research proposal should be conducted along with reference to the prolongation of the research proposal and cannot be voted against without this reference.

If no prolongation of research proposal is accepted - this proposal is considered as failed and nothing of the following processes is applicable to it.

Researchers based on goodwill should publish every research state and intermediate result as a corresponding commit to the repository.

Nevertheless, we suggest that every of the subDAO members can issue a request proposal for the intermediate results as a corresponded commitment. 

Chapter 3. Funding

Funding is an iteration process based on the SCV procedure.

Chapter 4. The role of software in a scientific research

Basically software has main roles:

Preparation of data to subsequent analysis,
Analysis of experimental data,
Conducting calculations for mathematical modeling of processes,
Symbolic and algebraic calculations which can be considered as the principle of research result (usually performed with mathematical CAD systems),
Logical reasoning and theorem proofs (usually performed with proof assistance)*, 
Computer science software as a research subject,
AI research.
Data collection
Stimulus presentation

In all cases except the latter two - software plays the secondary role in all of such kinds of research which means that, generally speaking, such studies could be conducted without software at all (theoretically).

However, the software can drastically increase promptness and accuracy making the investigation much more cost-effective.

In contrast, in the two latest cases the software plays a principal role being the subject of investigation itself. In the case of AI research the software plays a role as the main outcome. 

It divides the following narration in two sections.

Subsection 4.1. Computer aided research

Computer-aided research suggests that software artifact (a program) has the following features:

Text in computer-interpretable language (the code),
The code should be compiled or directly interpreted by external software (compiler or interpreter),
The intermediate results (if any) should be linked with standard system libraries (linker libraries),
The executable outcome should be run on specific operational system and hardware architecture,
The result of iterative execution of software should finally produce human-readable results independent of interpretability of intermediate results.

The process should be thought as an application of an extremely flexible and customisable measurer (computer) where the program plays the role of customization.

Being a hardware device, the computers used in scientific research should comply with the same requirements as all other devices which can be also used (described in section Devices).

The device microcode or firmware can be considered as a part of the device itself instead of separating it to isolated software architecture.

Customisable software associated with scientific result and used in scientific research according to the main principles should comply the following requirements:

The source code of software should be available,
The source code of software should be immutable meaning that the code itself is subject to be fixed in certain time and after evaluation,
The environment including hardware specification, OS and dependencies should be fixed as well,
The way of running software should be specified,
The way of interpreting results should be specified.   

The specification given in the previous enumeration should be given in a form which allows any external agent to reproduce the results without any necessity to additionally address an unspecified source of information and/or engineering skills.  

We claim that blockchain technology is an ultimate solution to comply with all given requirements as is:

Blockchain can be considered as persistent database of information pieces,
The decentralization nature of blockchain allows the introduction of unbiased assessment and treatment of those pieces of information according to the quazi-optimized meritocracy,
The blockchain running software (smart-contracts) currently allows to introduce any kinds of necessary public procedures such as voting, automatic triggering of pipeline stages, access control systems, distributed task management and full fledged financial transaction systems out of the box.   

Subsection 4.2. Research software as a subject of investigation

The first version of this manifest is not covered.

Chapter 5. Executable result

Any accepted commitment of the previous execution process could be labeled as final and triggers the next procedure.

The final commitment could be considered only after the round of voting procedure.

It must include accurate signs of results and executable procedure of it if applicable.

Subsection 5.1. Security and replicability of digital research processes

Reproducibility requirements can be satisfied by providing full and sound metadata to assemble, build and run dedicated software, such that the methodics of outcome interpreting gives the homogeneous result with respect to number and time of execution.

In computer engineering practice the latter can be achieved by creating so-called containers which are built on the top of given metadata.

Security and replicability are crucial components of every research study involving programming 
code to the process. Important that they have much in common.

We propose that every programming code involving in the research process should:

Securely and replicably retrieved from the code repository
 Securely and replicably compiled (built)
Securely and replicably run

To achieve that goals we propose three-component solution:

Control tool (probably CLI) to avoid extra dependencies which can e.g. be audited, commonly verified and publicly available along with a source to let all the users maximum confidence and correctness, and vulnerability resistance,
The distributed source code repository based on decentralized solution like blockchain to store all the needed packages’ source code, equipped with a comprehensive metadata and alone with initial images of containers (pre-images),
The system of containers management (the Docker as a principle example) allows the creation of isolated virtual instances of machines with defined image and customisable rules on external world and hosting machine interactions.

Having all of this we propose to follow the next steps to get security and replicability guarantees:

Download the trusted pre-image from a decentralized repository or start from an empty one, 
Start the corresponded container and restrict it from internet and hosting machine access,
Build all the necessary dependencies* of your scientific project inside the container using the verified control tool,
After each build process is completed - check the corresponded check-sums, hashes, etc to be strictly equal to what is openly published and supported by package maintainers (can be automated),
After all security checks are made, copy the resulting artifacts from virtual instance to real hosting machine - assuming the similarity between hosting and virtual architecture (must be accomplished on the first step).

*specifying repository, branch, commit or label

To give the built process maximum transparency, we propose to add build trace functionality and a comprehensive build information subsystem which allows the user to get all tracing 
In conclusion to the first version of this document, we propose that such approach guarantees no data leakage, no phishing issues, no commits mismatches, and checking the metadata hashes equality - full and uncompromised replicability.
