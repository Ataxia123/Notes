# Installing the CSS Snippet
This page shows you how to install the **cornell.css** snippet into your vault, which is needed to provide the unique "Cornell Notes".

Don't worry, you don't need to know CSS to use this solution.

## Install the snippet into your personal vault
>[!cue] Overview

This vault includes a file named **cornell.css**. The **cornell.css** file is a CSS file that contains all the information Obsidian will need to format notes using the *Cornell Notes style*. The file is located in a hidden folder inside the vault called .obsidian/snippets. 

>[!cue] Find the **cornell.css** file

To find the file:
- Open **Obsidian's Settings** 
- Select the **Appearances** tab and scroll to the bottom. You will see this:

- In the lower right corner, you will see a button with the image of a folder. When you click on this, it opens the "Open snippets folder". This is where Obsidian stores all the custom CSS snippets for a vault. *NOTE: Each vault has it's own snippets folder, that way each vault can be configured to be unique from other vaults on your system.*
- Click on the **Open snippets folder** button and the folder will open. A folder will appear. You should see the cornell.css file in this folder included in this learning vault.
