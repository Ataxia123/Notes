Nuclear power plants harness the energy released during nuclear fission to produce heat that generates high-pressure steam and ultimately spins a turbine to create electricity. A controlled chain reaction in the reactor core is maintained using uranium fuel, neutron moderators, and control rods. 

## Atomic Energy

Nuclear power harnesses the energy released from the splitting of atoms, otherwise known as nuclear fission, to produce electricity. At the fundamental level, nuclear power works the same way as more traditional forms of electricity generation - by using heat to power a turbine that spins a generator to produce electricity. However, nuclear power plants achieve that heat in a unique and complex way by utilizing nuclear reactions.  

Nuclear fission occurs when an atom is split into two or more lighter elements, releasing a large amount of energy in the process. This fission reaction is sustained in a nuclear reactor by bombarding fissile atoms, typically uranium-235, with neutrons released during fission. When a neutron hits a uranium-235 nucleus, it splits into smaller elements, liberating more neutrons and producing a large amount of heat energy. These secondary neutrons then hit other uranium-235 atoms in a self-sustaining chain reaction that maintains a steady output of heat.  


## The process

>[!cue] Reactor core & Nuclear fuel


The nuclear reactions in a power plant take place within the reactor core, which contains nuclear fuel assemblies made up of uranium fuel rods. Light water reactors, the most common type, use rods containing slightly enriched uranium-235 pellets encased in metal tubes. Control rods are inserted between the fuel rods to regulate the fission reaction by absorbing excess neutrons. Moderators like regular water or graphite are used to slow neutrons and maximize the chance they will split uranium atoms.

Coolant water continuously circulates through the system, absorbing heat from the reactor core. Traditional light water reactors use regular water as both coolant and neutron moderator. The heated coolant then flows into a steam generator containing separate feedwater pipes. The heat from the reactor coolant boils the feedwater into high-pressure steam that spins the turbine and generator to produce electricity. After passing through the turbine, the steam enters a condenser, cooled and condensed back into feedwater to complete the cycle.

Numerous safety systems and containment structures protect the public and the environment from any potential radiation risks. Control rods can quickly end the fission chain reaction if needed. Emergency core cooling systems inject borated water into the reactor core to absorb excess neutrons. Heavy concrete and steel containment buildings house the entire reactor system and are designed to withstand extreme internal pressures. Secondary barriers like an intact reactor vessel further isolate radioactive material. 

While nuclear power produces virtually no greenhouse gas emissions during operation, uranium mining, enrichment, waste management and decommissioning present environmental challenges. Strict regulation and oversight ensure the safety of nuclear power plants, but risks remain from potential accidents, natural disasters, and security threats. Properly managing and storing nuclear waste for the extremely long time frames required also poses technological and socioeconomic difficulties. Advances in reactor design aim to improve safety, reduce proliferation risks and create long-term waste solutions.
