# Welcome to the Cornell Notes Learning Vault for Obsidian

>[!cue] Cornell Notes 
>We will use the shorthand phrase **Cornell Notes** often to refer to the Cornell Note-Taking System

The [[Introduction to Cornell Notes|Cornell Note-Taking System]] was developed in the 1950s at Cornell University to help students take better notes. This system has stood the test of time and proven its value. 

I believe strongly it will help you to write better notes that will improve comprehension and memory retention. In fact, various studies have confirmed the value of Cornell Notes:
- Cornell notes are ... "effective when the synthesis, application, or evaluation is required".[*](https://soar.wichita.edu/bitstream/handle/10057/1388/grasp-2008-56.pdf)
- "the method can improve student's studying and listening skills" [*](https://rucore.libraries.rutgers.edu/rutgers-lib/51151/)

I can personally attest to the value of this method, as I have used it for decades and still have notes from years ago that I reference and have value in my life. 

Another thing that I like about the Cornell Note-taking system is that I can use it both in digital note-taking and note-taking on paper. The concepts are equally useful. This simplifies note-taking for me, not having some unique system just for Obsidian and something different for paper.

It is my goal to introduce you to a modern-day approach to implementing the Cornell Note-Taking System into your note-taking process.  This vault is intended to help you with the following:
- learn about the history and value of Cornell Notes.
- how to implement Cornell Notes into your note-taking and specifically how to do this in Obsidian.
- And along the way, several power-user tips acquired from my over 30 years of using this note-taking method

One of the best things about this system is you can use it both in taking notes on paper or digitally.  One system to rule them all? Profile not, but it is useful to have a system that translates into both paradigms.

## Getting Started
### 01 Index
>[!cue] [[01 INDEX]] is the home page for this vault


This vault is your "learning lab" for exploring Cornell Notes. The vault contains a document named [[01 INDEX]]. This is the document you will use as a starting point most frequently as it contains an index to all the files

### First Steps
If you are new to Cornell Notes, I recommend starting reading through these documents to lay a foundation for this method of not taking:
- [[Introduction to Cornell Notes|Introduction to the Cornell Note-Taking System]]
- [[Understanding the parts|Understanding the parts of a Cornell Note]]

### Visual Aspects
>[!cue] Sample documents

After that, take some time to look closely at the sample documents to learn the visual possibilities of Cornell Notes. It is important to understand how this method enhances comprehension, understanding, and retention. Sample documents are found in the *Sample Document* folder. Here is a list of the examples.
- [[The History of the Aegean Sea|The History of the Aegean Sea and its Importance to Greece]]
- [[Teaching Water Painting|Teaching Adults to Water Paint]]
- [[Meeting Notes]]
- [[Nuclear Power and how it works]]
- [[New Product - Quarterly Goals]]

### Using Cornell Notes in your vault

>[!cue] Your Vault

- First, you need to set up your vault to support the Cornell Notes styling of notes. To do that, follow the instructions for [[Installing the snippet|Installing the CSS Snippet]].
- Then move on to using the Cornell Notes styling in your notes. This document walks you through the process: [[Cornell Notes in Obsidian|How to take Cornell Notes in Obsidian]].
- To speed up working with Cornell notes in your vault, you may choose to enable an optional bonus feature of this vault: [[Using Templates]].
