The "Orellanismo PDF" is a thesis written by María Victoria Suárez Zavala, a student from the Faculty of Architecture and Design at the Universidad Católica de Santiago de Guayaquil. The thesis is titled "Orellanismo: Análisis tipológico de elementos semióticos encontrados en las fachadas de las edificaciones del Barrio Orellana" and was submitted as a requirement for obtaining the title of Architect.

## Key points of the thesis include:

- The thesis focuses on the analysis of semiotic elements found in the facades of buildings in the Barrio Orellana, a neighborhood in Guayaquil, Ecuador.

- The study is based on an interest in "architecture without architects", or architecture that is often overlooked despite constituting most of the city.

- The Barrio Orellana was designed by architects and built through a property company in the late 1940s. It was one of the first

- The thesis explores the architectural characteristics of the Barrio Orellana, including its unique design elements, the use of space, and the cultural and historical influences that have shaped its development.

- The study uses a semiotic approach to analyze the architectural elements of the neighborhood. Semiotics is the study of signs and symbols and their use or interpretation.

- The author identifies and categorizes different types of semiotic elements found in the facades of the buildings, such as colors, materials, shapes, and decorative elements.

- The thesis argues that these semiotic elements contribute to the identity of the Barrio Orellana and reflect the cultural and social values of its inhabitants.

- The study concludes with recommendations for preserving and enhancing the unique architectural and cultural heritage of the Barrio Orellana.

- The author suggests that understanding the semiotic elements of architecture can contribute to urban planning and design strategies that respect and enhance the cultural identity of neighborhoods.

- The thesis contributes to the field of architecture by providing a detailed analysis of a specific neighborhood and by demonstrating the value of a semiotic approach to understanding architecture.

based on this approach suggest a way to implement blockchain to mantain semiotic elements in design

Blockchain technology could be implemented to maintain semiotic elements in design in several ways:

**Digital Registry:** Blockchain could serve as a decentralized, immutable registry of semiotic elements in design. Each element could be recorded on the blockchain with its specific characteristics, historical significance, and cultural value. This would ensure the preservation of these elements and their meanings, even if the physical structures change over time.

**Intellectual Property Protection:** Blockchain could be used to protect the intellectual property rights of designers and architects. By recording designs on the blockchain, it would be possible to prove the originality of a design and prevent unauthorized use or copying.

**Collaboration and Participation**: Blockchain could facilitate collaboration and participation in the design process. By using smart contracts, different stakeholders (such as architects, designers, local communities, and cultural institutions) could contribute to the design process and make decisions collectively. This could help to ensure that semiotic elements are respected and integrated into new designs.

**Traceability and Transparency:** Blockchain could provide traceability and transparency in the design and construction process. This could help to ensure that semiotic elements are preserved and respected throughout the process. For example, it could be used to track the sourcing and use of materials that are significant in the local context.

**Education and Awareness:** A blockchain platform could also serve as an educational tool, providing information about the semiotic elements in design and their significance. This could raise awareness about the cultural and historical value of these elements and promote their preservation.
