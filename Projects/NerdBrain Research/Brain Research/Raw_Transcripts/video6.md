in previous videos we've talked a lot about we might say what what we study in psychology so we study things like we study the mind and we study the the brain and we study behavior and we ask questions like what what makes people think what they think and what makes people do what they do but there's a question that we haven't asked that's a really critical question which isn't what do we study in psychology but how how we study it how do we study these things and so this has to do with what we could call techniques techniques or methods methods of psychological research or more commonly if you're if you're taking if you're taking a class on this you'll hear it just called just called a research research methods and this is an entire field all to itself you can get a degree in research methods for psychology you can go on and make a career out of of just specializing and all of the different nuances and intricacies and complications that go into research methods but underlying all of that complexity there are certain core concepts that whatever type of study you're doing you're going to see some of these these same things coming up so the thing I want to start with is something that you'll see in essentially every psychological study and that's something called variables so a variable it's actually really nice in this case that the word itself tells us exactly what it means so a variable is just anything that's able to vary so we can put that it's something something that can change or or very so it could be something that varies over time or it could vary from one person to the next so let's get some let's get some concrete examples of variables just so we have something to talk about just to pull things some things off the top of my head at random height height would be a good example of a variable because you know you can have taller people or shorter people or you can see that height in vary over the course of a person's lifetime weight would be another example or we could go with something something very different like your like your income right income the amount of money that you make can vary or if you're a health psychologist you might be interested in what we would call your cardio vascular risk and that's a variable because you can have higher or lower levels of risk a this would be you know the the chances that you have of having some kind of problem with your heart or your blood vessels so for example having a heart attack and obviously you can have a higher level of risk or a lower lower level of risk and these are all things that psychologists study in different contexts something that would more kind of be typically thought of as a psychological variable we might have something like intelligence psychologists are very interested in why intelligence might vary from one person to the next or what different kinds of intelligence there might be or we similarly might be interested in why some people are more depressed than others so depression is a variable another example of a psychological variable stress which has a lot of very interesting research going on right now but the point is that whatever area of psychology you're looking at whatever kind of study a researcher might be doing there in some way going to be looking at some kind of a variable and so the simplest kind of study that we could do concerning a variable would be to just investigate one variable by itself so for example I might if I were a health psychologist I might just want to study cardiovascular risk and so I might go to a city and say in this particular area what is the level of cardiovascular risk how how much are people at risk of having a heart attack and that could give me some useful information if I find that the risk level is very high then maybe that tells me I need to do something to intervene and help those people so we can do and we do as psychologists conduct studies where we just look at a single variable but much more often rather than just looking at one variable by itself we don't we really want to understand the relationships relationships between variables so for example instead of just looking at cardiovascular risk by itself I could also go out and measure the level of stress all those stress that people are having in that area and then see is there a connection are the two related as you know if people have higher levels of stress do they also have higher levels of cardiovascular risk or or is there no particular relationship between the two another example would be well a like a fight if I look at income if I look at income by itself that's not really that interesting some people make more money and some people late make less and similarly similarly I can look at and something like height and also not very interesting right some people are taller and some people are shorter we all know that but if I then look for a relationship between the two suddenly I have a very interesting study I can ask questions like do people who are taller also tend to on average make more money and that would be a really interesting thing to find out so as we go on in future videos we'll talk about all kinds of different things interesting things that researchers have found out about variables and the relationships between those variables at the same time we'll also see that when you're when you're trying to investigate this kind of stuff there were a lot of challenges that can come up trying to see our two variables related and if so what is what's the kind of relationship we'll see there's different types of relate ways in which variables can be related for example we'll see that sometimes there's a clear relationship between two variables but we don't really know what's what's causing the relationship and to then dig deeper and find out what is the root cause can be extremely difficult and sometimes even impossible so there are a lot of techniques and methods that we've come up with to try to get around those different challenges and problems and we definitely can add on a lot of detail and complexity in terms of how we go about researching these different things but as we go forward and we talk about all all that complexity and all those details about research methods I hope that what you'll take away from this video is that underlying all that complexity were always still just talking about investigating variables and trying to see what are the relationships between those variables
