so in the last section we were talking about non scientific ways of knowing non scientific methods of acquiring knowledge and one of the main things we were talking one of main reasons we were talking about those was to see that they each have certain limitations so let me give you one more example of that let's talk about rational method or I'll just call it logic here okay if we're doing some logic to we can use logic to find out things right we can take things that we know and use logic to find out things that we didn't know to begin with so to take a really simple really classic example of a logical argument they might have something like Socrates is a man and all men are mortal these are two premises that we're starting out with the two things that we're saying we're taking these as given these are things that we know now let's try to find something we don't know so if Socrates is a man and all men are mortal we're going to say therefore something well but what you can see the conclusion is therefore Socrates is mortal right and that makes sense but here's another example we could start off with something like Socrates is a fish Oh fish like to eat cake therefore Socrates likes to eat cake now the question that I have for you is is this statement logical and you might be inclined to say no it's not logical but what you really mean is it's it's not true it is logical it is logically correct given this premise and this premise this conclusion is this conclusion logically follows so logic does not say anything about whether the premises that you're starting with your starting facts are correct they may be completely untrue no this may seem kind of silly but there have been people in historic historically who have tried to sort of sit around and just reason through things think about the universe and figure out how it works through logic but because they didn't check some of their starting facts they had all this wonderful perfect logic built on top of complete nonsense and so again with any one of these any single one of these non-scientific ways of knowing that we've been talking about rational method or logic or authority or tenacity or the intuition or empiricism every every method by itself has limitations like this one now what science does what the scientific method does is it combines different methods to sort of get the both best of both worlds to use what is good about one method to overcome limitations of another so for example we can use empiricism here the empirical method or empiricism and empiricism is just the idea that you know things by by observation right so this is about making direct observations to see what is to literally see or sometimes smell or hear or feel what is true and so obviously we can use empiricism to make some observations to check these premises is Socrates a fish well no I can see that he is actually a man do all fish like to eat cake well I can go out and actually look at different fashion maybe even try giving them some cake and I can observe whether they actually like to eat cake and so I can check these things using empirical observation if we turn it around the other way sometimes empiricism has some limitations for example you can't directly observe everything that you might like to know my favorite example of this is that astronomers are often very interested in seeing if there are planets orbiting distant stars stars other than our own but the problem is that we don't often have telescopes that are powerful enough in fact at the moment we don't have any telescopes powerful enough to directly observe planets around other stars they're currently working on improving our telescopes and sometime in the near future we might be able to do that but they've already discovered a number of different planets and the question is if they can't directly observe the planet well how do they know that it's there and the way that they do that is they use direct observations combined with logic in this case what they do is they it turns out that if a very massive object is orbiting a star it actually pulls on the star a little bit even though the star is so much larger than the thing that's going around it the start will actually wobble a little bit basically in its path through space so if you look out at a distant star and the star is big enough to see and you see it sort of moving around in a particular characteristic way you can logically infer from your knowledge of how gravity and mass work that something is pulling on that star and that it's probably a planet so the idea again now in science is that we're going to combine different methods to try to come up with some kind of combined system of approaching the world that gives us the most accurate view of what's actually going on out there we're sort of able to triangulate on the truth even if we can't always be totally certain we're going to try to triangulate on the byte by using the best we have from different different approaches each of which by itself has certain limitations
