in this video I'm going to go over the the scientific method the scientific method and the the steps that are involved in the scientific method and I kind of dislike this term because say the scientific method makes it sound like there's this one particular way that scientists always approach things they always do it in this order and that and that's not necessarily true scientists don't sit down and say oh what are the the five steps of the scientific method and let me start with step one I will make some observations in step two well generate a hypothesis it's going to have probably more variation than that in the real world but it is generally a good model for getting an idea of how scientists think and how they go through this process so step one step one is to make some observations I'll just say to observe and and these can be just casual and you'll see I'll contrast that with more systematic observations later on these are just casual or or informal informal observations and that this is the turn your textbook uses I actually like to call this I just like to call this just coming up with a question you're just questioning things an example that I really like is a very famous physicist by the name of Richard Fineman was sitting in a cafeteria one day and just casually not meaning to observe anything just casually sitting there watching what was going on he notices this guy throw a plate up in the air I was messing around throws this plate up in the air and Fineman notices something about how the plate is wobbling and as a physicist he gets just playful and curious about why that's the case and it sets him off on this it's the sequence of questioning things and trying out different ideas and formulas and eventually in many ways is is the what leads him to the work that gets him the Nobel Prize in Physics so all the time science just gets started by somebody noticing something wondering something about the world and why it's working that way the example they use in the textbook is pretty good actually they talk about people seem more depressed more depressed in winter than in summer and so that's that's you're wondering why is that the case the second step is you're going to come up with a hypothesis so you're going to high office size and a hypothesis let me just put this off to the side here apophysis is essentially just a a possible a possible or we could say tentative explanation so you're just saying well maybe this is the reason you are being tentative about it in the sense that you're very open at least ideally you are very open to the idea that it's wrong and that there is some other explanation that it's correct so you're just you're just throwing out some ideas now you might have very good reasons for those ideas or they might really just be guesses depending on what else you know about about what's going on so some examples of hypotheses and either way that's the plural if you have more than one and say you would say hypotheses so some examples of some hypotheses would be we might say oh I think there's there's more illness there's more illness in the winter I know that you know there's a lot more viruses and other germs going around so I think that the increased illness is causing people to just be more gloomy it's a bummer to get a cold there are also longer periods of darkness in the winter right there's longer period periods sorry mice pennis passing out their periods of darkness so that's an alternative hypothesis and often there are many different possible explanations so maybe increased hours of darkness in the winter longer nights in other words maybe that's what's causing depression okay so I have these possible explanations the next thing I am going to do with them is I'm gonna want to I want to test them before I test them on I need to kind of see where they lead what would be true if my hypothesis is correct what what would the implications be in other words what can I predict and so you're going to make predictions you're going to try to predict if this is true there's something that's going to be going on out there in the world and you know there's good predictions and there's bad predictions obviously your prediction needs to be something that you can ashlee observe it needs to be observable right if you're making some prediction about something that's going on 50 billion light years from Earth and there's no technology we have it's impossibly detected well that's not a you know very useful prediction in terms of of actually doing some research to find out so it should be observable it should be testable or should be able to actually check whether or not this prediction is correct another characteristic of a good prediction is how can I put this we want the we want the prediction we want our hypothesis to generate some prediction that doesn't have alternative explanations so we predict one particular thing and we can't come up with any other reasons why that would happen except for our art proposed explanation in other words aren't alternative explanations that can also account for what we're seeing preferably it doesn't always happen that way there's often you know often a scientist will say I've discovered why this thing is happening I have my hypothesis I mean its prediction the prediction was true my hypothesis is correct someone else will come along and say well actually the predictions that you observed those also fit my hypothesis which is very different from yours and so then we have to do some more work to try to disentangle those but you know some examples of this would be with following along with our example of depression let's say that our hypothesis that we chose was the was the idea of longer periods of darkness causing depression we decide we're going to test that one first and so we might look at different cities so for example in Phoenix Arizona right it's very sunny so we would expect we would expect in Phoenix there to be lower lowered levels of depression right and then we might look at someplace in like Scandinavia or something let's say let's say we look at Helsinki right during the winter time the winter time Helsinki and and we would expect there to be much higher rates of depression because the winters there whoops a pen keeps doing that the winters there the nights are much longer during the winter so we would expect there to be higher rates of depression and there are other ways we could do this that might be better if we have the time and the money we might be able to actually say go into I think in the text book they say you know you could go into a dormitory and you could install brighter light bulbs on one floor and darker light bulbs on the other and then you would predict of course that the floor with the brighter light bulbs the students are going to be less depressed okay so once we have our predictions the next two steps are maybe a little bit more obvious we have our predictions we have to go out there and actually check to see if the predictions are true in your book it talks about making observations which you are this sounds like step number one right because there we were observing as well but in this case you're making observations you know back in step number one we were doing it in an informal casual way just to kind of come up with ideas come up with things that we're wondering about in this case we are observing with the objective of testing we are trying to test the prediction we are trying to test the hypothesis to see if it is correct where it you know we're really trying to hammer on this thing in the sense that we're trying to we're trying to set it up in a way where if our hypothesis is wrong the tests will show that that's sort of the ideal and so we want we want our observations to be we want it to be systematic and what I mean by that will become more clear as we go through the book but the idea is we're trying to create a sort of formal you might say planned plans system or method that we're going to go through that allows us to be objective objective and by objective what we mean is free from bias we want the results of our tests not to be influenced by what we're hoping is true or what we are expecting to be true and that's why we need this very carefully planned out systematic way of doing it and that's kind of what you know the bulk of research methods is about you know we don't really need research methods to make some ups or casual observations come up with some ideas you know formulate a possible explanation maybe you start to get into it with trying to create some really good predictions but where you really get into the meat of research methods is with this testing phase this is where we're actually gonna go out and collect the data and try to see if what we what we predicted is true okay so then the last the last step is you've got your data you've made your test you pull all your in your your your data together and you evaluate it you evaluate it or you can see analyze the data to try to come up with some kind of a conclusion about what it means and by the way I'm using somewhat different titles for these steps than in the book mostly just to try to abbreviate them they have very long names for this to try to sort of simplify and abbreviate these down but when you are when you are a valley evaluating or analyzing your results the results can basically come out in one of these ways one is they could support they could support your hypothesis we don't tend to say that they prove the hypothesis because that implies that we're absolutely certain and one thing that we'll see about science is that we're rarely certain about things we usually have a certain level of a certain level of certainty a certain probability that the thing is true so for example if we find that yeah people are happier in all of the all of the sunnier cities or we install the light bulb on brighter light bulbs on a particular floor in the dormitory and the students on that floor are half year that supports our hypothesis but there's still other things that could potentially explain those results so we're not 100% sure that the hypothesis is true if if we go out there and test it and we just see no relationship between the amount of light and depression then we might be able to say you might be able to say that we have refuted refuted or rejected or disproved possibly disproved the hypothesis it's often more easier in science to conclusively prove that something isn't true than it is to prove conclusively that it is true and we'll we'll get into more detail about that later on and then of course you know this is a sort of sad truth about research that we often get results that are inconclusive and this is sort of the classic disappointing thing that happens to graduate students doing research is they have this beautiful hypothesis that they've come up with they do all this time formulating it and and developing it and arguing for why it's true or you know possibly true and they go out there and they and they test it and they something goes wrong with the study and they get results that are they don't really say one way or the other so for example in this case maybe we measure the students depression after we install these light bulbs and we see no relationship between light and depression there's there doesn't seem to be one but rather than refuting the hypothesis maybe we look at things a little more closely and we find out that there was something wrong with the way we measured depression maybe for example we find that the the depression questionnaire was in English and there happened to be a lot of exchange students on that floor of the dormitory and so there was a large percentage of students maybe who who didn't know how to respond properly or misinterpreted certain questions so though all those kinds of things can happen and in that case what you would want to do is you kind of go back to square one you'd really your techniques your methods and you probably have to conduct further research to try to get at what was happening
