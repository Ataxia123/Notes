so the next thing that they talked about in chapter 1 are what they call they call it methods of acquiring knowledge and and this is one of the things I think is a little funny about the way they present this some of the terms they give in this chapter they you know put these little boxes that define the terms as if this is some sort of official term that is used by all scientists everywhere and it's not it's just a phrase methods of acquiring knowledge it's just a phrase it means exactly what it says different techniques or ways of knowing something and in fact usually when I teach this I just call it just refer to it as ways of knowing in other words you you want to know something about the world about the state of reality and there are different techniques or methods or ways of going about finding those things out so this is not a question of what you know but more these are questions of how how do you know how do you know something and to give this overall context the reason why they're talking about this is you know we are going to spend the next three and a half months the entire rest of the book talking about one particular way of knowing which is research methods in other words the methods of science the as a way of knowing and so they're trying to in this first chapter sort of justify that they're trying to show you why why do we need to use that particular way of knowing instead of some other alternatives and so in this chapter they go over other but we might call non non scientific ways of knowing ok so some of the examples they give it and and this is not an exhaustive list we could talk about these different possibilities all day but they talk about the mess of tenacity they talk about intuition as a way of knowing they talk about Authority just getting your information from expert an expert on a subject they talk about what they call the rational method or you could just call this logic this is just figuring things out using a logical process of reasoning and they talk about the empirical empirical method which just has to do with observing things and I'm not going to go into detail on each of these they give you all of the information in the book but what I want to do here it kind of show you what sort of stuff should you know about these things so what they're going to do with each of these things they're going to they're going to give a definition of it they're going to say what it is you should obviously know that and then they're going to give some examples in each case and I don't necessarily think you should go through and memorize the examples they give but make sure that you understand the concept well enough that you would be able to think of which with each of these things think of an example so if someone says you know how do you know something by the method of Authority give an example of someone using the method of authority to know something and then what they're trying to lead into is this idea that each of these has some kind of limitations has limitations or problems with it and and the idea is that because of those limitations or problems that is why we turn to the scientific method why we turn to scientific research methods because those are a deliberate systematic attempt to know things in a way that overcomes these limitations so to make this a little clearer I will go into some detail on at least one let's just pick one let's look at the method of intuition so as as a definition this is just you know you believe something believe something because it feels feels true so if you get a gut feeling about something you don't really know why you feel a particular way that you feel that something is true that's your intuition you probably actually have a pretty good intuition about what intuition is the example on that they given the book is let me give a couple of different examples one is just you know you have some kind of an idea that like you know know your friend is having a bad day and again with intuition you don't know how you know that there's something you're picking up on but you're not consciously aware of it so an important part of the idea of intuition is that you're not not conscious not consciously aware of the process of the method in the say of the process in other words the way that you get the information you're not consciously aware of that once you get these knowledge you are aware of it so the idea is your brain is taking in information and processing it automatically subconsciously and then at the end of this process you end up with a conscious awareness of sort of what your your subconscious brain's ideas were right it took in some information it made some very rapid calculations and now it's saying here's the truth or here's the right decision now this is actually a really powerful important thing that your brain does intuition being this automatic process it's being able to pick up on all kinds of things that you're not even consciously aware of and give you a snap decision it happens very fast and you know we need to make hundreds and hundred of decisions and our every every single day in our lives and we don't have a lot of time to make them rationally or base them on scientific research so often your intuition is going to give you a remarkably fast and remarkably accurate idea of what the right choice is but it does have limitations the limitations come from this fact that it's it's not conscious right so there is in the book well the way they say this is there is no no mechanism no no my pen stabbed out there are no mechanism for telling and this is unrewarding this a little too simplified for telling true conclusions from untrue conclusions in other words yes there are other ways not intuition not the method of intuition that there are other ways that you can tell whether your intuition was correct right you can make observations you can reason through things logically you can gather some evidence to see if your intuitions worked right but though they're not part of intuition itself so the idea is what they're trying to show you is you cannot just use intuition to get through life if you really want to have an accurate understanding of what's happening in the world so it's not to say that it's not essential it's an incredibly important part of how our brains work and there are often times where we should pay very close attention to our intuition where our intuition is telling us something very important but what they're saying is that because of these limitations it's not enough by itself and the limitation is because we're not consciously aware of the process we don't know how we arrived at the conclusion we arrived at we got some kind of information our brain interpreted that information subconsciously automatically and then it generated this conclusion this feeling about what is correct but we don't know how it got there so if it made a mistake which it often does with our intuition we won't note and the end result will be that we'll feel right even when we're wrong so this is how I summarized it is and it'll say this in your textbook this is how I remember it you feel right actually I'm going to going to say this a little differently this actually comes from a great TED talk and I'll I'll post the link to it in case you're curious but being wrong when you're using intuition being wrong feels what does it feel like well you might say it feels bad it feels terrible but that's what it feels like to find out that you are wrong when you're just wrong and you don't know it because your intuition made a mistake and that's all subconscious and you have no access to it being wrong feels it feels like being right and so that is why we can't use intuition alone and then the same sort of idea of having a definition an example of it and limitations that justify why we have to look at science we're going to see that's the case with always with tenacity intuition Authority just using a rational or logical method or just using an empirical method using any one of these things by itself is going to have limitations so as you study through this section you should make sure that you know you know that each of these things the definition be able to come up with an example be able to recognize an example of this if you saw it if I told you something like Jane is walking down the street and there's a guy coming the other way on the street and she just has a really bad feeling about it that makes her cross to the other side of the road you should be able to recognize that that's the method of intuition and then you should also be able to say what are the limitations or problems with that way of knowing
