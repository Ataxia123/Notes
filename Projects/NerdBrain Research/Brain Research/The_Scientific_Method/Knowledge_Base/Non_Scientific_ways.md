>[!cue] Non-Scientific ways of Acquiring Knowledge

In this video, the concept of non-scientific ways of acquiring knowledge is discussed. One of these methods is the rational method or logic, which involves using logical arguments to find out new information. However, it is important to note that logic does not determine the truth of the premises, only the logical correctness of the conclusion based on those premises. Another non-scientific method mentioned is empiricism, which involves making direct observations to determine what is true. Empiricism can be used to check the validity of premises. However, it also has limitations, as not everything can be directly observed. The video emphasizes that science combines different methods, such as logic and empiricism, to overcome the limitations of each individual method and obtain a more accurate understanding of the world.
