# Defining_Hyperstructures

A hyperstructure, as defined in the note [[Hyperstructures]], is a crypto protocol that can run for free and forever, without maintenance, interruption or intermediaries. The main characteristics of a hyperstructure are:

1. **Unstoppable:** The protocol cannot be stopped by anyone. It runs for as long as the underlying blockchain exists.
2. **Free:** There is a 0% protocol wide fee and runs exactly at gas cost.
3. **Valuable:** Accrues value which is accessible and exitable by the owners.
4. **Expansive:** There are built-in incentives for participants in the protocol.
5. **Permissionless:** Universally accessible and censorship resistant. Builders and users cannot be deplatformed.
6. **Positive sum:** It creates a win-win environment for participants to utilize the same infrastructure.
7. **Credibly neutral:** The protocol is user-agnostic.
