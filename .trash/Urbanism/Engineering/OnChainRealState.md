- Objective: To finance construction projects using onChain funds.

Problem statement: Constructors are forced to work with the same parties who have access to capital in order to create large scale building projects. On chain funding provides an avenue for new mixed types of financing to be implemented allowing for more transparently funded projects sourced from individuals rather than corporations


- Aproaches:
-> [[Security offering]]: Investment device with a fixed percentage return promise. This is done issuing a redeemable note on chain for the investment + promised return using a smart contract

-> [[Property management]]: Selling property units as NFTs and offer property management and occupancy services to keep cashflow. done using staking contract to offer property to rent.

### ChatGPT Analysis

[[OnChainRealState]] presents a novel approach to real estate financing by leveraging blockchain technology. Here are the pros, cons, and steps forward for each approach:

**1. Security Offering:**
   **- Pros**: This approach provides a clear return on investment for investors, making it attractive for those seeking a predictable income. It also allows for a broad pool of investors, potentially increasing the amount of capital available for construction projects.
   **- Cons:** The fixed return promise might limit the potential upside for investors if the project performs exceptionally well. Additionally, the legal and regulatory landscape for security offerings on the blockchain is still evolving, which could pose challenges.
   **- Steps Forward:** To implement this approach, it would be necessary to develop a smart contract that can issue the redeemable note. Legal advice should also be sought to ensure compliance with securities laws.

**2. Property Management:**
   **- Pros:** Selling property units as NFTs could democratize access to real estate investment, allowing individuals to own a piece of a property. The property management and occupancy services could provide a steady cash flow.
   **- Cons**: This approach might be complex to manage, as it involves both real estate and blockchain technology. There could also be legal and regulatory challenges related to the sale of property as NFTs.
   **- Steps Forward:** A staking contract would need to be developed to offer the property for rent. Legal advice should be sought to navigate the legal and regulatory landscape.

**3. Mixed Approach:**
   **- Pros:** This approach combines the benefits of the security offering and property management approaches, potentially providing both a fixed return and a steady cash flow. It could also attract a broader range of investors.
   **- Cons:** The mixed approach could be even more complex to manage than the other two approaches. It could also face additional legal and regulatory challenges due to the combination of different investment structures.
   **- Steps Forward:** Both a smart contract for the redeemable token equity and a staking contract for the property rental would need to be developed. Legal advice should be sought to ensure compliance with securities and real estate laws.

In all cases, it would be important to educate potential investors about the benefits and risks of investing in on-chain real estate. This could involve developing educational materials and hosting informational events. Additionally, partnerships could be formed with real estate and blockchain companies to leverage their expertise and resources.
