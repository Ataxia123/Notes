## sqtPriceX96 calculation
[source](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EV23xTgWsnY)

ratio = sqtPriceX96 ** 2 / 196 ** 2 
  ```javascript
  const handleAmountChange = (e: React.ChangeEvent<HTMLInputElement>, slot: "slot0" | "slot1") => {
    let input = Number(e.target.value)
    const ttp = Number(mappedResult.sqrtPriceX96) ** 2 / 2 ** 192;
    if (slot === "slot0") {

      const calculatedAmount = input * ttp;
      setAmounts({ amount0: input, amount1: calculatedAmount })
    }
    else {

      const calculatedAmount = input / ttp;
      setAmounts({ amount0: calculatedAmount, amount1: input })
    }
  };

Uniswap [documentation on quoting](https://docs.uniswap.org/sdk/v3/guides/quoting)
tickToPrice [example](https://github.com/Rachel-Eichenberger/Uniswap-Examples-V3/blob/main/TickToPrice.js)

function TickToPrice(tick, token0Decimals, token1Decimals){
	let price0 = (1.0001**tick)/(10**(token1Decimals-token0Decimals));
	let price1 = 1 / price0;
	return [price0.toFixed(token1Decimals), price1.toFixed(token0Decimals)]
}
## Referencing the Quoter contract and getting a quote
Like we did for the Pool contract, we need to construct an instance of an ethers Contract for our Quoter contract in order to interact with it:

Setting up a reference to the Quoter contract
```javascript

const quoterContract = new ethers.Contract(
  QUOTER_CONTRACT_ADDRESS,
  Quoter.abi,
  getProvider()
)
```


We get access to the contract's ABI through the @uniswap/v3-periphery package, which holds the periphery smart contracts of the Uniswap V3 protocol:

Uniswap V3 Quoter smart contract ABI
import Quoter from '@uniswap/v3-periphery/artifacts/contracts/lens/Quoter.sol/Quoter.json'
View on Github
We can now use our Quoter contract to obtain the quote.

<mark>In an ideal world, the quoter functions would be view functions, which would make them very easy to query on-chain with minimal gas costs. However, the Uniswap V3 Quoter contracts rely on state-changing calls designed to be reverted to return the desired data. </mark>This means calling the quoter will be very expensive and should not be called on-chain.

<mark>To get around this difficulty, we can use the callStatic method provided by the ethers.js</mark> Contract instances. This is a useful method that submits a state-changing transaction to an Ethereum node, but <mark>asks the node to simulate the state change, rather than to execute it. </mark>Our script can then return the result of the simulated state change:

Getting Quotes from the Quoter contract
```javascript
const quotedAmountOut = await quoterContract.callStatic.quoteExactInputSingle(
  poolConstants.token0,
  poolConstants.token1,
  poolConstants.fee,
  fromReadableAmount(
    CurrentConfig.tokens.amountIn,
    CurrentConfig.tokens.in.decimals
  ).toString(),
  0
)
```

The result of the call is the number of output tokens you'd receive for the quoted swap.

It should be noted that quoteExactInputSingle is only 1 of 4 different methods that the quoter offers:

quoteExactInputSingle - given the amount you want to swap, produces a quote for the amount out for a swap of a single pool
quoteExactInput - given the amount you want to swap, produces a quote for the amount out for a swap over multiple pools
quoteExactOutputSingle - given the amount you want to get out, produces a quote for the amount in for a swap over a single pool
quoteExactOutput - given the amount you want to get out, produces a quote for the amount in for a swap over multiple pools
