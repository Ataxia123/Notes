Now that we have the rules in the brain i'm just trying to figure out how to play

because you could have a thingy where if you make something illegal it doesnt compile somehow therefore it doesnt get pushed, We need to establish something there

basically if you start someone in a tavern and they have a character sheet you could ensure he only does valid actions

I see. My initial thought is do what we did for the Denver MVP. Guessing with Obsidian using the ChatGPT plugin, give it the initial "be the DM" prompt and then let it loose while it having the ability to reference notes. The "be the DM prompt" did a pretty good job at keeping people to rules and possibilities of their character.

More of a prompt challenge more than anything?
