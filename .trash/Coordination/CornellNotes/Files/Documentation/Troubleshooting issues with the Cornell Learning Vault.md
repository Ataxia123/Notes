#### Confirm your Obsidian and installer are up-to-date
Make sure that your Obsidian is up-to-date. Go into Settings and the About tab. There you will find the **current version** and the **Installer version**. Please confirm that you mean the minimum version requirements.
- Current version: 1.3.0 or higher. If you have an older version, click on the **Check for Updates** button.
- Installer version 1.3.5 or higher. If you have an older version, you will need to go to https://obsidian.md and download the newest installer, and reinstall Obsidian. The good news is this only updates Obsidian and doesn't require reconfiguring Obsidian.
