The girlfriend is having a carpet cleaning job today, so I won't be livestreaming Kin-dza-dza! to her... Room temperature superconductor time then. Tagging

Okay, so Landau, huh. The progenitor of all quantum physics angel girls, person described by fucking Science Committee of CC CP USSR (people with unhinged enthusiasm) as a person with unhinged enthusiasm.

Author of the first theory of superconductivity, and also half the other physics.

He penned, with Lifschitz, the best physics textbook still - if your contact with physics was marred by presence of "Feynman Lectures" this is a good antidote and I recommend reading it always.

However, type I superconductor is only a very special case of Landau's theory of superconductivity and some people had to finish his work. For example, for 1D case, where electrons can not go around each other, Tomonaga liquid theory was developed.

In the West it is known as Luttinger liquid, for the guy who kept making various wrong additions to it.



Anyway, in 1986 YBCO - the first high temperature superconductor was developed, immediately freed of patenting and posted everywhere, including high schooler newspapers. Community outreach etc.


YBCO is easy to make, and it gets superconductivity at liquid nitrogen which is relatively accessible. So, a hunt for both representative superconductors and a good theory of high temperature superconductivity began.


In 2005, when everyone was working with carbon nanotubes and fullerens, Tomonaga liquid proximity induced superconductivity was first demonstrated by Dr. Haruyama Junji et al.


1D superconductors present a lucrative field for high temperature superconductivity because in 1D systems kinetic energy of heat is 3-6 times lower than in 3D one, for obvious reasons. Carbon nanotubes proved to be bad for this purpose however.

So when the papers came out they were basically too lukewarm in content for me to not disregard them - lots of screaming around something that doesn't challenge anything is usually a sign of Drama Afoot and I don't like it and I initially dismissed it. Dunce Hat on.



So, on to the actual meat of concept. I had everything to reproduce the experiement on hand and we kinda needed a good buck converter for a different project. So I was promised a beef steak with potato and asparagus if I improve the protocol until Tuesday.



So, the first thing I have seen is. They obtain lanarkite through baking PbO and PbSO4 which is insane. Lanarkite is a primary precipitate in aqueous solutions outside of "concentrated sulphuric acid" acidity. Here I used 1/100 of my solutions (i. e. 1/10000 of product)

Anyway I then washed the more particulate lanarkite with isopropanol and dried it, allow me to skip this step

Next is... They reacted copper with phosphorus at 500 degrees and I honestly not sure what was that. Phosphorus sublimates at 250 or something, copper remains solid until 1000. Why? Unclear

it probably uses copper powder and ignites it with phosphorus like the old synthesis of zinc sulfide or that demo with sulfur and iron powder
Radio Free Aryl 🧪 🥭 🏳️‍⚧️

another way, but could make a slightly different material could be bubbling phosphine gas into copper (II) solution, but phosphine is horrendously poisonous


I need copper (I) phosphide unfortunately, else I would have reacted CuSO4 with potassium polyphosphide long ago ^^"
Radio Free Aryl 🧪 🥭 🏳️‍⚧️

Oh right, i can see that now

Anyway original mixture is purple with orange....

The article says that they acquired the Cu3P in a vacuum furnace at 550°C in 48 hours.
This is remarkable because it takes 15 minutes on Матрёна in a usual flask with helium.

Radio Free Aryl 🧪 🥭 🏳️‍⚧️

shine a UV light at it pls

Yeah, it emits at 730nm, unfortunately it is not a wavelength to which a camera is super sensitive, though my chlorophyll fluorescence-trained eye does discern it

630 longpass filter only marginally improves the situation.

Yeah, it seems to be related to the fact that all of the human cameras I have have 700nm shortpass ('IR-CUT') filter.

IRRELEVANT, SOY MILK

Oh, branched the actual step into the wrong reply chain. Lmao.

Replying to @endless_sine and @ATinyGreenCell
Yeah, but I simply layered copper beads from drawer over red phosphorus and heated it to 250degC under helium. Like, you don't get more reactive than P4 gas honestly, but I also don't like burning phosphorus. Reminds me of my childhood too much.

Anyway, this NOT the first one superconductor in this class, but it is a first one-dimensional, so an interesting opportunity emerges for engineering conductivity pili of bacteria into the superconductors of this class.

IT'S ON DISCOUNT

Jesus fuck it's plausible

I think I solved the mystery of 550°C
Red phosphorus does melt at 550°C!
At 3MPa. Not 0,001 Torr

We need to make 96 plate crucibles for those of us who are uninitiated in The MolBiol Way. Also it would have helped me out right now

Almost home, so let's return to our lambs.
So far we made a host lattice of basic lead sulphate.
And made a two dimensional oxidized 2D lattice of copper (i) ions that we intend to turn into 1D wires.
We have also reduced elemental phosphorus to +3 - its full [Ar] layer.

Now, see, sulphate is highly (+6) oxidized sulphur - period three chalcogen. Phosphorus is a period three pnictogen reduced to [Ar]. We are going to strip this man naked.

Sulphur is a gas at the temperature, and that's good!
Unfortunately the material science guys seem to be unaware of that.
Instead of removing evaporating sulphur efficiently by using a solid sink or like argon purge they seal it in the glass ampoule with product

SULPHUR EVAPORATING IS A THERMODYNAMIC DRIVER OF THIS PROCESS. WHY WOULD YOU PREVENT IT FROM LEAVING.

Anyway, if any kind of madwoman decides to follow what I do step by step - I recommend sieving the Cu3P instead of grinding it, as it removes unreacted chunks of phosphorus and copper.

I also recommend sieving it before reaction to improve accessibility of copper surface to P4

Anyway, now on to the fun part.
I glued the small porcelain crucible into the bigger nickel one with silicate glue and then popped it like popcorn, while leaving a tiny trail of c-- snot to the side. 
This is actually very important.

Oh god I forgot to filter half of the anger youghurt fuck

Though it will be more than enough for today, I don't want to stretch this any more

Added to the tray, it will dry out soon, in the meanwhile I will be putting silicon carbide into the flower pot

.......
I accidentally put 17% of Cu3P powder in. Making more lanarkite to dilute

Positive modality: hey if prep doesn't take 10 hours you sure can do a lot with mistake tolerance
Negative modality: They should make a science for girls who are stupid

Negative × 2 modality: They aren't making the science for girls who are stupid. "Saving the drowning is only the deal of drowning themselves"
Iris

Positive Negative Negative modality: hey at least it's fun

Helium, lid, helium, lid, flowerpot above, helium from below, heat on

To see how efficient the setup is for eliminating chalcogens I did this funny thing also.

By screening the results of this for any conductivity at all I have decided to go to sleep, aka "overnight annealing"

This is consistent with my idea that removal of sulphur - through oxidizing it away with oxygen in this case - is imperative to drive the process

As a result, we reached some surprising conclusions that we thought we need to share. So here is a writeup, titled "On LK-99 papers". By Seo Sanghyeon, Kang Seonghoon, and Kim Joongi. Thank you, you are my best friends forever. [[KoreanPaper]]
Okay, so I *did* get conductive samples of #LK99 , but I kinda failed to make an open ring out of it because I didn't passivate nickel crucible enough and it malfunctioned hilariously. Absolutely does not constitute improvement :>I
