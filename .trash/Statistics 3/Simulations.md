Statistical simulations refer to computational models that try to predict the behavior of a complex system. The field of simulation involves a number of different approaches.

Computer simulations can be broadly classified into three main categories:

1. [[Deterministic Simulations]]: These simulations do not involve any randomness. The same input will always produce the same output. They are often used in engineering and physics to model deterministic systems where the outcome is entirely determined by the initial conditions and inputs.

2. [[Stochastic Simulations]]: These simulations incorporate randomness. They are used to model systems that have an element of uncertainty or randomness, such as the stock market or weather patterns. Statistical simulations fall under this category.

3. [[Hybrid Simulations]]: These simulations combine elements of both deterministic and stochastic simulations. They are used to model complex systems that have both deterministic and random elements.

Each of these types of simulations can be further divided based on the specific techniques and algorithms used, the scale of the system being modeled (microscopic vs macroscopic), and the level of detail included in the model (e.g., individual-based vs population-based models).
