The **scientific method** is an [empirical](/wiki/Empirical_evidence "Empirical evidence") method for acquiring [knowledge](/wiki/Knowledge "Knowledge") that has characterized the development of [science](/wiki/Science "Science") since at least the 17th century (with notable practitioners in previous centuries; see the article [history of scientific method](/wiki/History_of_scientific_method "History of scientific method") for additional detail.) It involves careful [observation](/wiki/Observation "Observation"), applying rigorous [skepticism](/wiki/Skepticism "Skepticism") about what is observed, given that [cognitive assumptions](/wiki/Philosophy_of_science#Observation_inseparable_from_theory "Philosophy of science") can distort how one interprets the [observation](/wiki/Perception#Process_and_terminology "Perception"). It involves formulating [hypotheses](/wiki/Hypothesis "Hypothesis"), via [induction](/wiki/Inductive_reasoning "Inductive reasoning"), based on such observations; the [testability](/wiki/Testability "Testability") of hypotheses, [experimental](/wiki/Experiment "Experiment") and the measurement-based statistical testing of [deductions](/wiki/Deductive_reasoning "Deductive reasoning") drawn from the hypotheses; and refinement (or elimination) of the hypotheses based on the experimental findings. These are _principles_ of the scientific method, as distinguished from a definitive series of steps applicable to all scientific enterprises.[[1]](#cite_note-1)[[2]](#cite_note-2)[[3]](#cite_note-3)

Although procedures vary from one [field of inquiry](/wiki/Branches_of_science "Branches of science") to another, the underlying [process](#Process) is frequently the same from one field to another. The process in the scientific method involves making [conjectures](/wiki/Conjecture "Conjecture") (hypothetical explanations), deriving predictions from the hypotheses as logical consequences, and then carrying out experiments or empirical observations based on those predictions.[[a]](#cite_note-fallingBodies-4)[[4]](#cite_note-NA-5) A hypothesis is a conjecture, based on knowledge obtained while seeking answers to the question. The hypothesis might be very specific, or it might be broad. Scientists then test hypotheses by conducting experiments or studies. A scientific hypothesis must be [falsifiable](/wiki/Falsifiable "Falsifiable"), implying that it is possible to identify a possible outcome of an experiment or observation that conflicts with predictions deduced from the hypothesis; otherwise, the hypothesis cannot be meaningfully tested.[[5]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEPopper1959273-6)

The purpose of an experiment is to determine whether [observations](#Characterizations)[[A]](#cite_note-aQuestion-7)[[a]](#cite_note-fallingBodies-4)[[b]](#cite_note-alhacenCharacterizes-8) agree with or conflict with the [expectations](#Predictions_from_the_hypothesis) deduced from a hypothesis.[[6]](#cite_note-smith2001-9): Book I, [6.54] pp.372, 408 [[b]](#cite_note-alhacenCharacterizes-8) Experiments can take place anywhere from a garage to a remote mountaintop to CERN's [Large Hadron Collider](/wiki/Large_Hadron_Collider "Large Hadron Collider"). There are difficulties in a formulaic statement of method, however. Though the scientific method is often presented as a fixed sequence of steps, it represents rather a set of general principles.[[7]](#cite_note-allScience-10) Not all steps take place in every [scientific inquiry](#Scientific_inquiry) (nor to the same degree), and they are not always in the same order.[[8]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEGauch20033-11)[[9]](#cite_note-Inductive_Science_1837-12)

[Aristotle](/wiki/Aristotle "Aristotle") (384–322 BCE). "As regards his method, Aristotle is recognized as the inventor of scientific method because of his refined analysis of logical implications contained in demonstrative discourse, which goes well beyond natural logic and does not owe anything to the ones who philosophized before him." – Riccardo Pozzo[[10]](#cite_note-13)

[![](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_method//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f4/Hazan.png/180px-Hazan.png)](/wiki/File:Hazan.png)

[Ibn al-Haytham](/wiki/Ibn_al-Haytham "Ibn al-Haytham") (965–1039). A polymath, considered by some to be the father of modern scientific [methodology](/wiki/Methodology "Methodology"), due to his emphasis on experimental data and [reproducibility](/wiki/Reproducibility "Reproducibility") of its results.[[11]](#cite_note-news.bbc.co.uk-14)[[12]](#cite_note-15)[[13]](#cite_note-treatiseOnLight-16)

[![](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_method//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/74/JKepler.jpg/180px-JKepler.jpg)](/wiki/File:JKepler.jpg)

[Johannes Kepler](/wiki/Johannes_Kepler "Johannes Kepler") (1571–1630). "Kepler shows his keen logical sense in detailing the whole process by which he finally arrived at the true orbit. This is the greatest piece of Retroductive reasoning ever performed." – [C. S. Peirce](/wiki/Charles_Sanders_Peirce "Charles Sanders Peirce"), c. 1896, on Kepler's reasoning through explanatory hypotheses[[14]](#cite_note-17)

[![](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_method//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cc/Galileo.arp.300pix.jpg/180px-Galileo.arp.300pix.jpg)](/wiki/File:Galileo.arp.300pix.jpg)

[Galileo Galilei](/wiki/Galileo_Galilei "Galileo Galilei") (1564–1642). According to [Albert Einstein](/wiki/Albert_Einstein "Albert Einstein"), "All knowledge of reality starts from experience and ends in it. Propositions arrived at by purely logical means are completely empty as regards reality. Because Galileo saw this, and particularly because he drummed it into the scientific world, he is the father of modern physics – indeed, of modern science altogether."[[15]](#cite_note-18)

Important debates in the history of science concern skepticism that anything can be known for sure (such as views of [Francisco Sanches](/wiki/Francisco_Sanches#That_Nothing_Is_Known "Francisco Sanches")), [rationalism](/wiki/Rationalism "Rationalism") (especially as advocated by [René Descartes](/wiki/Ren%C3%A9_Descartes "René Descartes")), [inductivism](/wiki/Inductivism "Inductivism"), [empiricism](/wiki/Empiricism "Empiricism") (as argued for by [Francis Bacon](/wiki/Francis_Bacon "Francis Bacon"), then rising to particular prominence with [Isaac Newton](/wiki/Isaac_Newton "Isaac Newton") and his followers), and [hypothetico-deductivism](/wiki/Hypothetico-deductivism "Hypothetico-deductivism"), which came to the fore in the early 19th century.

The term "scientific method" emerged in the 19th century, when a significant institutional development of science was taking place and terminologies establishing clear [boundaries](/wiki/Demarcation_problem "Demarcation problem") between science and non-science, such as "scientist" and "pseudoscience", appeared.[[16]](#cite_note-Thurs-19) Throughout the 1830s and 1850s, at which time Baconianism was popular, naturalists like William Whewell, John Herschel, John Stuart Mill engaged in debates over "induction" and "facts" and were focused on how to generate knowledge.[[16]](#cite_note-Thurs-19) In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, a debate over [realism](/wiki/Philosophical_realism "Philosophical realism") vs. [antirealism](/wiki/Antirealism "Antirealism") was conducted as powerful scientific theories extended beyond the realm of the observable.[[17]](#cite_note-auto-20)

The term "scientific method" came into popular use in the twentieth century; [Dewey's 1910 book](#CITEREFDewey1910), _[How We Think](/wiki/How_We_Think "How We Think")_, inspired [popular guidelines](#aGuideline),[[18]](#cite_note-cowles-21) popping up in dictionaries and science textbooks, although there was little consensus over its meaning.[[16]](#cite_note-Thurs-19) Although there was growth through the middle of the twentieth century, by the 1960s and 1970s numerous influential philosophers of science such as [Thomas Kuhn](/wiki/Thomas_Kuhn "Thomas Kuhn") and [Paul Feyerabend](/wiki/Paul_Feyerabend "Paul Feyerabend") had questioned the universality of the "scientific method" and in doing so largely replaced the notion of science as a homogeneous and universal method with that of it being a heterogeneous and local practice.[[16]](#cite_note-Thurs-19) In particular, Paul Feyerabend, in the 1975 first edition of his book _[Against Method](/wiki/Against_Method "Against Method")_, argued against there being any universal rules of [science](/wiki/Science "Science");[[17]](#cite_note-auto-20) Popper 1963,[[19]](#cite_note-trialAndErr-22) Gauch 2003,[[7]](#cite_note-allScience-10) and Tow 2010[[20]](#cite_note-tow-23) disagree with Feyerabend's claim; [problem solvers](/wiki/Problem_solving "Problem solving"), and researchers are to be prudent with their resources during their inquiry.[[B]](#cite_note-FRL-1.136-27)[[c]](#cite_note-nextItemToSettle-30)

Later stances include physicist [Lee Smolin](/wiki/Lee_Smolin "Lee Smolin")'s 2013 essay "There Is No Scientific Method",[[26]](#cite_note-31) in which he espouses two [ethical principles](#ethicalPosition),[[e]](#cite_note-ethicalPosition-33) and [historian of science](/wiki/History_of_science "History of science") Daniel Thurs's chapter in the 2015 book _Newton's Apple and Other Myths about Science_, which concluded that the scientific method is a myth or, at best, an idealization.[[27]](#cite_note-34) As [myths](#Beliefs_and_biases) are beliefs,[[28]](#cite_note-beliefCreatesReality-35) they are subject to the [narrative fallacy](/wiki/Narrative_fallacy "Narrative fallacy") as Taleb points out.[[29]](#cite_note-narrativeFallacy-36) Philosophers [Robert Nola](/wiki/Robert_Nola "Robert Nola") and Howard Sankey, in their 2007 book _Theories of Scientific Method_, said that debates over scientific method continue, and argued that Feyerabend, despite the title of _Against Method_, accepted certain rules of method and attempted to justify those rules with a meta methodology.[[30]](#cite_note-37) Staddon (2017) argues it is a mistake to try following rules in the absence of an algorithmic scientific method; in that case, "science is best understood through examples".[[f]](#cite_note-39) But algorithmic methods, such as _disproof of existing theory by experiment_ have been used since Alhacen (1027) _Book of Optics_,[[b]](#cite_note-alhacenCharacterizes-8) and Galileo (1638) _Two New Sciences_,[[32]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEGalileo_Galilei1638-40) and _The Assayer_[[33]](#cite_note-ilSaggiatore-41) still stand as scientific method. They contradict Feyerabend's stance. [[C]](#cite_note-introspection-43)[[D]](#cite_note-vacuum-46)

The ubiquitous element in the scientific method is [empiricism](/wiki/Empiricism "Empiricism"). This is in opposition to stringent forms of [rationalism](/wiki/Rationalism "Rationalism"): the scientific method embodies the position that reason alone cannot solve a particular scientific problem. A strong formulation of the scientific method is not always aligned with a form of [empiricism](/wiki/Empiricism "Empiricism") in which the empirical data is put forward in the form of experience or other abstracted forms of knowledge; in [current scientific practice](#aModel), however, the use of [scientific modelling](/wiki/Scientific_modelling "Scientific modelling") and reliance on abstract typologies and theories is normally accepted. The scientific method counters claims that [revelation](/wiki/Revelation "Revelation"), political or religious [dogma](/wiki/Dogma "Dogma"), appeals to tradition, commonly held beliefs, common sense, or currently held theories pose the only possible means of demonstrating truth.[[37]](#cite_note-truthSought4sake-47)[[21]](#cite_note-reasonsFirstRule-24)[[20]](#cite_note-tow-23)

Different early expressions of empiricism and the scientific method can be found throughout history, for instance with the ancient [Stoics](/wiki/Stoics "Stoics"), [Epicurus](/wiki/Epicurus "Epicurus"),[[38]](#cite_note-Asmis-48) [Alhazen](/wiki/Alhazen "Alhazen"),[[E]](#cite_note-50) [Avicenna](/wiki/Ibn_Sina "Ibn Sina"), [Al-Biruni](/wiki/Al-Biruni "Al-Biruni"),[[39]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEAlikuzai2013154-51)[[40]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTERozhanskayaLevinova1996-52) [Roger Bacon](/wiki/Roger_Bacon "Roger Bacon"), and [William of Ockham](/wiki/William_of_Ockham "William of Ockham"). From the 16th century onwards, experiments were advocated by [Francis Bacon](/wiki/Francis_Bacon "Francis Bacon"), and performed by [Giambattista della Porta](/wiki/Giambattista_della_Porta "Giambattista della Porta"),[[41]](#cite_note-53) [Johannes Kepler](/wiki/Johannes_Kepler "Johannes Kepler"),[[42]](#cite_note-55)[[i]](#cite_note-Kepler1604-56) and [Galileo Galilei](/wiki/Galileo_Galilei "Galileo Galilei").[[j]](#cite_note-empirical-57) There was particular development aided by theoretical works by [Francisco Sanches](/wiki/Francisco_Sanches "Francisco Sanches"),[[43]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTESanchesLimbrickThomson1988-58) [John Locke](/wiki/John_Locke "John Locke"), [George Berkeley](/wiki/George_Berkeley "George Berkeley"), and [David Hume](/wiki/David_Hume "David Hume").

A sea voyage from America to Europe afforded [C. S. Peirce](/wiki/C._S._Peirce "C. S. Peirce") the distance to clarify [his ideas](#coord3kinds),[[F]](#cite_note-59) gradually resulting in the [hypothetico-deductive model](/wiki/Hypothetico-deductive_model "Hypothetico-deductive model").[[44]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEGodfrey-Smith2003236-60) Formulated in the 20th century, the model has undergone significant revision since first proposed (for a more formal discussion, see [§ Elements of the scientific method](#Elements_of_the_scientific_method)).

## Overview

The [DNA example](#DNA_example) below is a synopsis of this method.

The scientific method is the process by which [science](/wiki/Science "Science") is carried out.[[45]](#cite_note-allTheSciences-61) As in other areas of inquiry, science (through the scientific method) can build on previous knowledge and develop a more sophisticated understanding of its topics of study over time.[[k]](#cite_note-63)[[47]](#cite_note-sn1987a-64)[[48]](#cite_note-Fixation-65)[[49]](#cite_note-66)[[50]](#cite_note-67)[[51]](#cite_note-Vital-68)[[52]](#cite_note-Anti-fragility-69) This model can be seen to underlie the [scientific revolution](/wiki/Scientific_revolution "Scientific revolution").[[53]](#cite_note-lindberg2007-70)

### Process

The overall process involves making [conjectures](/wiki/Conjecture "Conjecture") ([hypotheses](/wiki/Hypothesis "Hypothesis")), deriving predictions from them as logical consequences, and then carrying out experiments based on those predictions to determine whether the original conjecture was correct.[[4]](#cite_note-NA-5) There are difficulties in a formulaic statement of method, however. Though the scientific method is often presented as a fixed sequence of steps, these actions are better considered as general principles.[[8]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEGauch20033-11) Not all steps take place in every scientific inquiry (nor to the same degree), and they are not always done in the same order. As noted by scientist and philosopher [William Whewell](/wiki/William_Whewell "William Whewell") (1794–1866), "invention, sagacity, [and] genius"[[9]](#cite_note-Inductive_Science_1837-12) are required at every step.

#### Formulation of a question

The question can refer to the explanation of a specific [observation](/wiki/Observation "Observation"),[[A]](#cite_note-aQuestion-7) as in "Why is the sky blue?" but can also be open-ended, as in "How can I [design a drug](/wiki/Drug_design "Drug design") to cure this particular disease?" This stage frequently involves finding and evaluating evidence from previous experiments, personal scientific observations or assertions, as well as the work of other scientists. If the answer is already known, a different question that builds on the evidence can be posed. When applying the scientific method to research, determining a good question can be very difficult and it will affect the outcome of the investigation.[[54]](#cite_note-71)

#### Hypothesis

A [hypothesis](/wiki/Hypothesis "Hypothesis") is a conjecture, based on knowledge obtained while formulating the question, that may explain any given behavior. The hypothesis might be very specific; for example, Einstein's [equivalence principle](/wiki/Equivalence_principle "Equivalence principle") or [Francis Crick](/wiki/Francis_Crick "Francis Crick")'s "DNA makes RNA makes protein",[[l]](#cite_note-72) or it might be broad; for example, "unknown species of life dwell in the unexplored depths of the oceans". _See [§ Hypothesis development](#Hypothesis_development)_

A [statistical hypothesis](/wiki/Statistical_hypothesis_testing#Definition_of_terms "Statistical hypothesis testing") is a [conjecture](/wiki/Conjecture "Conjecture") about a given [statistical population](/wiki/Statistical_population "Statistical population"). For example, the population might be _people with a particular disease_. One conjecture might be that a new drug will cure the disease in some of the people in that population, as in a [clinical trial](/wiki/Clinical_trial "Clinical trial") of the drug.[[55]](#cite_note-gates-73) A [null hypothesis](/wiki/Null_hypothesis "Null hypothesis") would conjecture that the statistical hypothesis is false; for example, that the new drug does nothing, and that any cure in the population would be caused by [chance](/wiki/Luck "Luck") (a [random variable](/wiki/Random_variable "Random variable")).

An [alternative to the null hypothesis](/wiki/Alternative_hypothesis "Alternative hypothesis"), to be [falsifiable](/wiki/Falsifiable "Falsifiable"), must say that a treatment program with the drug does better than chance. To test the statement _a treatment program with the drug does better than chance_, an experiment is designed in which a portion of the population (the control group), is to be left untreated, while another, separate portion of the population is to be treated.[[56]](#cite_note-hannan-74) [t-Tests](/wiki/T-Test "T-Test") could then specify how large the treated groups, and how large the control groups are to be, in order to infer whether some course of treatment of the population has resulted in a cure of some of them, in each of the groups.[[m]](#cite_note-misuseTtests-76) The groups are examined, in turn by the researchers, in a [protocol](/wiki/Protocol_(science) "Protocol (science)").[[n]](#cite_note-77)

[Strong inference](/wiki/Strong_inference "Strong inference") could alternatively propose multiple alternative hypotheses embodied in [randomized controlled trials](/wiki/Randomized_controlled_trial "Randomized controlled trial"), treatments A, B, C, ... , (say in a [blinded experiment](/wiki/Blinded_experiment "Blinded experiment") with varying dosages, or with lifestyle changes, and so forth) so as not to introduce [confirmation bias](/wiki/Confirmation_bias "Confirmation bias") in favor of a specific course of treatment.[[58]](#cite_note-platt-78) Ethical considerations could be used, to minimize the numbers in the untreated groups, e.g., use almost every treatment in every group, but excluding A, B, C, ..., respectively as controls.[[o]](#cite_note-79)[[p]](#cite_note-factorialExperiments-80)

#### Prediction

The prediction step deduces the logical consequences of the hypothesis _before the outcome is known_. These predictions are expectations for the results of testing. If the result is already known, it is evidence that is ready to be considered in acceptance or rejection of the hypothesis. The evidence is also stronger if the actual result of the predictive test is not already known, as tampering with the test can be ruled out, as can [hindsight bias](/wiki/Hindsight_bias "Hindsight bias") (see [postdiction](/wiki/Postdiction "Postdiction")). Ideally, the prediction must also distinguish the hypothesis from likely alternatives; if two hypotheses make the same prediction, observing the prediction to be correct is not evidence for either one over the other. (These statements about the relative [strength of evidence](/wiki/Strength_of_evidence "Strength of evidence") can be mathematically derived using [Bayes' Theorem](/wiki/Bayes%27_Theorem "Bayes' Theorem")).[[q]](#cite_note-81)

The consequence, therefore, is to be stated at the same time or briefly after the statement of the hypothesis, but before the experimental result is known.

Likewise, the test protocol is to be stated before execution of the test. These requirements become precautions against tampering, and aid the reproducibility of the experiment.

#### Testing

Suitable tests[[23]](#cite_note-SuitableTest-26)[[22]](#cite_note-econ-25) of a hypothesis compare the [expected values](/wiki/Expected_value "Expected value") from the tests of that hypothesis with the actual results of those tests. Scientists (and other people) can then [secure, or discard, their hypotheses](#hisPragmatism) by conducting suitable [experiments](#Experiments).

#### Analysis

An analysis determines, from the results of the experiment, the next actions to take. The expected values from the test of the alternative hypothesis are compared to the [expected values](/wiki/Expected_value "Expected value") resulting from the null hypothesis (that is, a prediction of no difference in the [status quo](/wiki/Status_quo "Status quo")). The difference between _expected versus actual_ indicates which hypothesis better explains the resulting data from the experiment. In cases where an experiment is repeated many times, a [statistical analysis](/wiki/Statistics "Statistics") such as a [chi-squared test](/wiki/Chi-squared_test "Chi-squared test") whether the null hypothesis is true, may be required.

Evidence from other scientists, and from experience are available for incorporation at [any stage in the process](#Replication). Depending on the complexity of the experiment, iteration of the process may be required to gather sufficient evidence to answer the question with confidence, or to build up other answers to highly specific questions, to answer a single broader question.

When the evidence has falsified the alternative hypothesis, a new hypothesis is required; if the evidence does not conclusively justify discarding the alternative hypothesis, other predictions from the alternative hypothesis might be considered. Pragmatic considerations, such as the resources available to continue inquiry, might guide the investigation's further course.[[B]](#cite_note-FRL-1.136-27) When evidence for a hypothesis strongly supports that hypothesis, further questioning can follow, for insight into the broader inquiry under investigation.

### DNA example

![](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_method//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/93/DNA_icon_%2825x25%29.png) The basic [elements of the scientific method](#Elements_of_the_scientific_method) are illustrated by the following example (which occurred from 1944 to 1953) from the discovery of the structure of [DNA](/wiki/DNA "DNA"):

- _[Question](#DNA-characterizations)_: Previous investigation of DNA had determined its chemical composition (the four [nucleotides](/wiki/Nucleotide "Nucleotide")), the structure of each individual nucleotide, and other properties. DNA had been identified as the carrier of genetic information by the [Avery–MacLeod–McCarty experiment](/wiki/Avery%E2%80%93MacLeod%E2%80%93McCarty_experiment "Avery–MacLeod–McCarty experiment") in 1944,[[59]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMcCarty1985252-82) but the mechanism of how genetic information was stored in DNA was unclear.[[60]](#cite_note-florenceBell-83)
- _[Hypothesis](#DNA-hypotheses)_: [Linus Pauling](/wiki/Linus_Pauling "Linus Pauling"), [Francis Crick](/wiki/Francis_Crick "Francis Crick") and [James D. Watson](/wiki/James_D._Watson "James D. Watson") hypothesized that DNA had a helical structure.[[61]](#cite_note-84)
- _[Prediction](#DNA-predictions)_: If DNA had a helical structure, its X-ray diffraction pattern would be X-shaped.[[62]](#cite_note-McElheny_2004_43-85)[[63]](#cite_note-Crick_pp._137–138-86) This prediction was determined using the mathematics of the helix transform, which had been derived by Cochran, Crick, and Vand[[64]](#cite_note-HelixTransform-87) (and independently by Stokes). This prediction was a mathematical construct, completely independent from the biological problem at hand.
- _[Experiment](#DNA-experiments)_: [Rosalind Franklin](/wiki/Rosalind_Franklin "Rosalind Franklin") used pure DNA to perform [X-ray diffraction](/wiki/X-ray_diffraction "X-ray diffraction") to produce [photo 51](/wiki/Photo_51 "Photo 51"). The results showed an X-shape.
- _[Analysis](#DNA-iterations)_: When Watson saw the detailed diffraction pattern, he immediately recognized it as a helix.[[24]](#cite_note-TeaTime-28)[[65]](#cite_note-Watson_1968_167-88)[[c]](#cite_note-nextItemToSettle-30) He and Crick then produced their model, using this information along with the previously known information about DNA's composition, especially Chargaff's rules of base pairing.[[25]](#cite_note-SameShape-29)

The discovery became the starting point for many further studies involving the genetic material, such as the field of [molecular genetics](/wiki/Molecular_genetics "Molecular genetics"), and it was awarded the [Nobel Prize](/wiki/Nobel_Prize_in_Physiology_or_Medicine "Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine") in 1962. Each step of the example is examined in more detail later in the article.

### Other components

The scientific method also includes other components required even when all the iterations of the steps above have been completed:[[32]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEGalileo_Galilei1638-40)

#### Replication

If an experiment cannot be [repeated](/wiki/Reproducibility "Reproducibility") to produce the same results, this implies that the original results might have been in error. As a result, it is common for a single experiment to be performed multiple times, especially when there are uncontrolled variables or other indications of [experimental error](/wiki/Observational_error "Observational error"). For significant or surprising results, other scientists may also attempt to replicate the results for themselves, especially if those results would be important to their own work.[[66]](#cite_note-89) Replication has become a contentious issue in social and biomedical science where treatments are administered to groups of individuals. Typically an _experimental group_ gets the treatment, such as a drug, and the _control group_ gets a placebo. [John Ioannidis](/wiki/John_Ioannidis "John Ioannidis") in 2005 pointed out that the method being used has led to many findings that cannot be replicated.[[67]](#cite_note-90)

#### External review

The process of [peer review](/wiki/Peer_review "Peer review") involves evaluation of the experiment by experts, who typically give their opinions anonymously. Some journals request that the experimenter provide lists of possible peer reviewers, especially if the field is highly specialized. Peer review does not certify the correctness of the results, only that, in the opinion of the reviewer, the experiments themselves were sound (based on the description supplied by the experimenter). If the work passes peer review, which occasionally may require new experiments requested by the reviewers, it will be published in a peer-reviewed [scientific journal](/wiki/Academic_journal "Academic journal"). The specific journal that publishes the results indicates the perceived quality of the work.[[r]](#cite_note-91)

#### Data recording and sharing

Scientists typically are careful in recording their data, a requirement promoted by [Ludwik Fleck](/wiki/Ludwik_Fleck "Ludwik Fleck") (1896–1961) and others.[[68]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEFleck1979xxvii–xxviii-92) Though not typically required, they might be requested to [supply this data](/wiki/Data_sharing "Data sharing") to other scientists who wish to replicate their original results (or parts of their original results), extending to the sharing of any experimental samples that may be difficult to obtain.[[69]](#cite_note-93) _See [§Communication and community](#Communication_and_community)._

#### Instrumentation

_See [scientific community](/wiki/Scientific_community "Scientific community"), [big science](/wiki/Big_science "Big science")._

Institutional researchers might acquire an [instrument](/wiki/Machine "Machine") to [institutionalize](/wiki/Institution "Institution") their tests. These instruments would use [observations](/wiki/Observation "Observation") of the real world, which might agree with, or perhaps conflict with, their [predictions](#Prediction) deduced from their [hypothesis](#Hypothesis). These institutions thereby reduce the research function to a cost/benefit,[[70]](#cite_note-conjugatePairs-94) which is expressed as money, and the time and attention of the researchers to be expended,[[70]](#cite_note-conjugatePairs-94) in exchange for a report to their constituents.[[71]](#cite_note-nsf-95)

Current large instruments, such as CERN's [Large Hadron Collider](/wiki/Large_Hadron_Collider "Large Hadron Collider") (LHC),[[72]](#cite_note-lhc-96) or [LIGO](/wiki/LIGO "LIGO"),[[73]](#cite_note-ligo-97) or the [National Ignition Facility](/wiki/National_Ignition_Facility "National Ignition Facility") (NIF),[[74]](#cite_note-nif-98) or the [International Space Station](/wiki/International_Space_Station "International Space Station") (ISS),[[75]](#cite_note-iss-99) or the [James Webb Space Telescope](/wiki/James_Webb_Space_Telescope "James Webb Space Telescope") (JWST),[[76]](#cite_note-jwst-100)[[77]](#cite_note-jwstDeploymentSeq-101) entail expected costs of billions of dollars, and timeframes extending over decades. These kinds of institutions affect public policy, on a national or even international basis, and the researchers would require shared access to such machines and their [adjunct infrastructure](#otherScientists).[[s]](#cite_note-feedTheMachinery-102)[[78]](#cite_note-Crutchfield-103) _See [Perceptual control theory](/wiki/Perceptual_control_theory "Perceptual control theory"), [§Open-loop and closed-loop feedback](/wiki/Control_theory#Open-loop_and_closed-loop_(feedback)_control "Control theory")_

## Elements of the scientific method

There are different ways of outlining the basic method used for scientific inquiry. The [scientific community](/wiki/Scientific_community "Scientific community") and [philosophers of science](/wiki/Philosophers_of_science "Philosophers of science") generally agree on the following classification of method components. These methodological elements and organization of procedures tend to be more characteristic of [experimental sciences](/wiki/Experimental_science "Experimental science") than [social sciences](/wiki/Social_science "Social science"). Nonetheless, the cycle of formulating hypotheses, testing and analyzing the results, and formulating new hypotheses, will resemble the cycle described below.

The scientific method is an iterative, cyclical process through which information is continually revised.[[79]](#cite_note-104)[[80]](#cite_note-Brody-1993-105) It is generally recognized to develop advances in knowledge through the following elements, in varying combinations or contributions:[[48]](#cite_note-Fixation-65)[[51]](#cite_note-Vital-68)

- Characterizations (observations, definitions, and measurements of the subject of inquiry)
- Hypotheses (theoretical, hypothetical explanations of observations and measurements of the subject)
- Predictions (inductive and deductive reasoning from the hypothesis or theory)
- Experiments (tests of all of the above)

Each element of the scientific method is subject to [peer review](/wiki/Peer_review "Peer review") for possible mistakes. These activities do not describe all that scientists do but [apply mostly to experimental sciences](#Beliefs_and_biases) (e.g., physics, chemistry, biology, and psychology). The elements above are often taught in [the educational system](/wiki/Education "Education") as "the scientific method".[[A]](#cite_note-aQuestion-7)

The scientific method is not a single recipe: it requires intelligence, imagination, and creativity.[[81]](#cite_note-106) In this sense, it is not a mindless set of standards and procedures to follow, but is rather an [ongoing cycle](#Evaluation_and_improvement), constantly developing more useful, accurate, and comprehensive models and methods. For example, when Einstein developed the Special and General Theories of Relativity, he did not in any way refute or discount Newton's _Principia_. On the contrary, if the astronomically massive, the feather-light, and the extremely fast are removed from Einstein's theories – all phenomena Newton could not have observed – Newton's equations are what remain. Einstein's theories are expansions and refinements of Newton's theories and, thus, increase confidence in Newton's work.

An iterative,[[80]](#cite_note-Brody-1993-105) pragmatic[[37]](#cite_note-truthSought4sake-47) scheme of the four points above is sometimes offered as a guideline for proceeding:[[82]](#cite_note-107)

1. Define a question
2. Gather information and resources (observe)
3. Form an explanatory hypothesis
4. Test the hypothesis by performing an experiment and collecting data in a [reproducible](/wiki/Reproducibility "Reproducibility") manner
5. Analyze the data
6. Interpret the data and draw conclusions that serve as a starting point for a new hypothesis
7. Publish results
8. Retest (frequently done by other scientists)

The iterative cycle inherent in this step-by-step method goes from point 3 to 6 back to 3 again.

While this schema outlines a typical hypothesis/testing method,[[83]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEGauch2003esp._chapters_5–8-108) many philosophers, historians, and sociologists of science, including [Paul Feyerabend](/wiki/Paul_Feyerabend "Paul Feyerabend"),[[t]](#cite_note-descartes-110) claim that such descriptions of scientific method have little relation to the ways that science is actually practiced.

### Characterizations

The scientific method depends upon increasingly sophisticated characterizations of the subjects of investigation. (The _subjects_ can also be called [_unsolved problems_](/wiki/Category:Lists_of_unsolved_problems "Category:Lists of unsolved problems") or the _unknowns_.)[[A]](#cite_note-aQuestion-7) For example, [Benjamin Franklin](/wiki/Benjamin_Franklin "Benjamin Franklin") conjectured, correctly, that [St. Elmo's fire](/wiki/St._Elmo%27s_fire "St. Elmo's fire") was [electrical](/wiki/Electrical "Electrical") in [nature](/wiki/Nature "Nature"), but it has taken a long series of experiments and theoretical changes to establish this. While seeking the pertinent properties of the subjects, careful thought may also [entail](/wiki/Logical_consequence "Logical consequence") some definitions and observations; the [observations](/wiki/Observations "Observations") often demand careful [measurements](/wiki/Measurements "Measurements") and/or counting.

The systematic, careful collection of measurements or counts of relevant quantities is often the critical difference between [pseudo-sciences](/wiki/Pseudoscience "Pseudoscience"), such as alchemy, and science, such as chemistry or biology. Scientific measurements are usually tabulated, graphed, or mapped, and statistical manipulations, such as [correlation](/wiki/Correlation "Correlation") and [regression](/wiki/Regression_analysis "Regression analysis"), performed on them. The measurements might be made in a controlled setting, such as a laboratory, or made on more or less inaccessible or unmanipulatable objects such as stars or human populations. The measurements often require [specialized](#Instrumentation) [scientific instruments](/wiki/Scientific_instrument "Scientific instrument") such as [thermometers](/wiki/Thermometer "Thermometer"), [spectroscopes](/wiki/Spectrometer "Spectrometer"), [particle accelerators](/wiki/Particle_accelerator "Particle accelerator"), or [voltmeters](/wiki/Voltmeter "Voltmeter"), and the progress of a scientific field is usually intimately tied to their invention and improvement.

> — [Andreas Vesalius](/wiki/Andreas_Vesalius "Andreas Vesalius"), (1546)[[85]](#cite_note-111)

#### Uncertainty

Measurements in scientific work are also usually accompanied by estimates of their [uncertainty](/wiki/Uncertainty "Uncertainty").[[70]](#cite_note-conjugatePairs-94) The uncertainty is often estimated by making repeated measurements of the desired quantity. Uncertainties may also be calculated by consideration of the uncertainties of the individual underlying quantities used. Counts of things, such as the number of people in a nation at a particular time, may also have an uncertainty due to [data collection](/wiki/Data_collection "Data collection") limitations. Or counts may represent a sample of desired quantities, with an uncertainty that depends upon the [sampling method](/wiki/Sampling_method "Sampling method") used and the number of samples taken.

#### Definition

Measurements demand the use of _[operational definitions](/wiki/Operational_definition "Operational definition")_ of relevant quantities. That is, a scientific quantity is described or defined by how it is measured, as opposed to some more vague, inexact, or "idealized" definition. For example, [electric current](/wiki/Electric_current "Electric current"), measured in amperes, may be operationally defined in terms of the mass of silver deposited in a certain time on an electrode in an electrochemical device that is described in some detail. The operational definition of a thing often relies on comparisons with standards: the operational definition of "mass" ultimately relies on the use of an artifact, such as a particular kilogram of platinum-iridium kept in a laboratory in France.

The scientific definition of a term sometimes differs substantially from its [natural language](/wiki/Natural_language "Natural language") usage. For example, [mass](/wiki/Mass "Mass") and [weight](/wiki/Weight "Weight") overlap in meaning in common discourse, but have distinct meanings in [mechanics](/wiki/Mechanics "Mechanics"). Scientific quantities are often characterized by their [units of measure](/wiki/Units_of_measurement "Units of measurement") which can later be described in terms of conventional physical units when communicating the work.

New theories are sometimes developed after realizing certain terms have not previously been sufficiently clearly defined. For example, [Albert Einstein](/wiki/Albert_Einstein "Albert Einstein")'s first paper on [relativity](/wiki/Special_relativity "Special relativity") begins by defining [simultaneity](/wiki/Relativity_of_simultaneity "Relativity of simultaneity") and the means for determining [length](/wiki/Length "Length"). These ideas were skipped over by [Isaac Newton](/wiki/Isaac_Newton "Isaac Newton") with, "I do not define [time](/wiki/Time_in_physics#Galileo:_the_flow_of_time "Time in physics"), space, place and [motion](/wiki/Motion_(physics) "Motion (physics)"), as being well known to all." Einstein's paper then demonstrates that they (viz., absolute time and length independent of motion) were approximations. [Francis Crick](/wiki/Francis_Crick "Francis Crick") cautions us that when characterizing a subject, however, it can be premature to define something when it remains ill-understood.[[86]](#cite_note-112) In Crick's study of [consciousness](/wiki/Consciousness "Consciousness"), he actually found it easier to study [awareness](/wiki/Awareness "Awareness") in the [visual system](/wiki/Visual_system "Visual system"), rather than to study [free will](/wiki/Free_will "Free will"), for example. His cautionary example was the gene; the gene was much more poorly understood before Watson and Crick's pioneering discovery of the structure of DNA; it would have been counterproductive to spend much time on the definition of the gene, before them.

#### DNA-characterizations

![](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_method//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/93/DNA_icon_%2825x25%29.png)

The [history](/wiki/DNA#History "DNA") of the discovery of the structure of DNA is a classic example of [the elements of the scientific method](#Elements_of_the_scientific_method): in 1950 it was known that [genetic inheritance](/wiki/Genetic_inheritance "Genetic inheritance") had a mathematical description, starting with the studies of [Gregor Mendel](/wiki/Gregor_Mendel "Gregor Mendel"), and that DNA contained genetic information (Oswald Avery's _transforming principle_).[[59]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMcCarty1985252-82) But the mechanism of storing genetic information (i.e., genes) in DNA was unclear. Researchers in [Bragg's](/wiki/William_Lawrence_Bragg "William Lawrence Bragg") laboratory at [Cambridge University](/wiki/University_of_Cambridge "University of Cambridge") made [X-ray](/wiki/X-ray "X-ray") [diffraction](/wiki/Diffraction "Diffraction") pictures of various [molecules](/wiki/Molecule "Molecule"), starting with [crystals](/wiki/Crystal "Crystal") of [salt](/wiki/Salt "Salt"), and proceeding to more complicated substances. Using clues painstakingly assembled over decades, beginning with its chemical composition, it was determined that it should be possible to characterize the physical structure of DNA, and the X-ray images would be the vehicle.[[87]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMcElheny200434-113) [.._2. DNA-hypotheses_](#DNA-hypotheses)

#### Another example: precession of Mercury

[![](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_method//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e2/Perihelio.svg/220px-Perihelio.svg.png)](/wiki/File:Perihelio.svg)

[Precession](/wiki/Apsidal_precession "Apsidal precession") of the [perihelion](/wiki/Perihelion_and_aphelion "Perihelion and aphelion") – exaggerated in the case of Mercury, but observed in the case of [S2](/wiki/S2_(star) "S2 (star)")'s [apsidal precession](/wiki/Apsidal_precession "Apsidal precession") around [Sagittarius A*](/wiki/Sagittarius_A* "Sagittarius A*")[[88]](#cite_note-114)

The characterization element can require extended and extensive study, even centuries. It took thousands of years of measurements, from the [Chaldean](/wiki/Chaldea "Chaldea"), [Indian](/wiki/India "India"), [Persian](/wiki/History_of_Iran "History of Iran"), [Greek](/wiki/Greece "Greece"), [Arabic](/wiki/Arabs "Arabs"), and [European](/wiki/Ethnic_groups_in_Europe "Ethnic groups in Europe") astronomers, to fully record the motion of planet [Earth](/wiki/Earth "Earth"). Newton was able to include those measurements into the consequences of his [laws of motion](/wiki/Newton%27s_laws_of_motion "Newton's laws of motion"). But the [perihelion](/wiki/Perihelion_and_aphelion "Perihelion and aphelion") of the planet [Mercury](/wiki/Mercury_(planet) "Mercury (planet)")'s [orbit](/wiki/Orbit "Orbit") exhibits a precession that cannot be fully explained by Newton's laws of motion (see diagram to the right), as Leverrier pointed out in 1859. The observed difference for Mercury's [precession](/wiki/Apsidal_precession "Apsidal precession") between Newtonian theory and observation was one of the things that occurred to [Albert Einstein](/wiki/Albert_Einstein "Albert Einstein") as a possible early test of his theory of [General relativity](/wiki/General_relativity "General relativity"). His relativistic calculations matched observation much more closely than did Newtonian theory. The difference is approximately 43 arc-seconds per century.

### Hypothesis development

Main article: [Hypothesis formation](/wiki/Hypothesis_formation "Hypothesis formation")

A [hypothesis](/wiki/Hypothesis "Hypothesis") is a suggested explanation of a phenomenon, or alternately a reasoned proposal suggesting a possible correlation between or among a set of phenomena.

Normally hypotheses have the form of a [mathematical model](/wiki/Mathematical_model "Mathematical model"). Sometimes, but not always, they can also be formulated as [existential statements](/wiki/Existential_quantification "Existential quantification"), stating that some particular instance of the phenomenon being studied has some characteristic and causal explanations, which have the general form of [universal statements](/wiki/Universal_quantification "Universal quantification"), stating that every instance of the phenomenon has a particular characteristic.

Scientists are free to use whatever resources they have – their own creativity, ideas from other fields, [inductive reasoning](/wiki/Inductive_reasoning "Inductive reasoning"), [Bayesian inference](/wiki/Bayesian_inference "Bayesian inference"), and so on – to imagine possible explanations for a phenomenon under study. Albert Einstein once observed that "there is no logical bridge between phenomena and their theoretical principles."[[89]](#cite_note-115)[[u]](#cite_note-leapIsInvolved-117) [Charles Sanders Peirce](/wiki/Charles_Sanders_Peirce "Charles Sanders Peirce"), borrowing a page from [Aristotle](/wiki/Aristotle "Aristotle") (_[Prior Analytics](/wiki/Prior_Analytics "Prior Analytics")_, [2.25](/wiki/Inquiry#Abduction "Inquiry"))[[91]](#cite_note-aristotleAbduction-118) described the incipient stages of [inquiry](/wiki/Inquiry "Inquiry"), instigated by the "irritation of doubt" to venture a plausible guess, as _[abductive reasoning](/wiki/Abductive_reasoning "Abductive reasoning")_.[[34]](#cite_note-How-42): II, p.290  The history of science is filled with stories of scientists claiming a "flash of inspiration", or a hunch, which then motivated them to look for evidence to support or refute their idea. [Michael Polanyi](/wiki/Michael_Polanyi "Michael Polanyi") made such creativity the centerpiece of his discussion of methodology.

[William Glen](/wiki/William_Glen_(geologist_and_historian) "William Glen (geologist and historian)") observes that[[92]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEGlen199437–38-119)

> the success of a hypothesis, or its service to science, lies not simply in its perceived "truth", or power to displace, subsume or reduce a predecessor idea, but perhaps more in its ability to stimulate the research that will illuminate ... bald suppositions and areas of vagueness.
> 
> — William Glen, _The Mass-Extinction Debates_

In general scientists tend to look for theories that are "[elegant](/wiki/Elegance "Elegance")" or "[beautiful](/wiki/Beauty "Beauty")". Scientists often use these terms to refer to a theory that is following the known facts but is nevertheless relatively simple and easy to handle. [Occam's Razor](/wiki/Occam%27s_Razor "Occam's Razor") serves as a rule of thumb for choosing the most desirable amongst a group of equally explanatory hypotheses.

To minimize the [confirmation bias](/wiki/Confirmation_bias "Confirmation bias") which results from entertaining a single hypothesis, [strong inference](/wiki/Strong_inference "Strong inference") emphasizes the need for entertaining multiple alternative hypotheses.[[58]](#cite_note-platt-78)

#### DNA-hypotheses

![](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_method//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/93/DNA_icon_%2825x25%29.png)

[Linus Pauling](/wiki/Linus_Pauling "Linus Pauling") proposed that DNA might be a [triple helix](/wiki/Triple_helix "Triple helix").[[93]](#cite_note-120) This hypothesis was also considered by [Francis Crick](/wiki/Francis_Crick "Francis Crick") and [James D. Watson](/wiki/James_D._Watson "James D. Watson") but discarded. When Watson and Crick learned of Pauling's hypothesis, they understood from existing data that Pauling was wrong.[[94]](#cite_note-121) and that Pauling would soon admit his difficulties with that structure. So, the race was on to figure out the correct structure (except that Pauling did not realize at the time that he was in a race) _[..3. DNA-predictions](#DNA-predictions)_

### Predictions from the hypothesis

Main article: [Prediction in science](/wiki/Prediction_in_science "Prediction in science")

Any useful hypothesis will enable [predictions](/wiki/Prediction "Prediction"), by [reasoning](/wiki/Reasoning "Reasoning") including [deductive reasoning](/wiki/Deductive_reasoning "Deductive reasoning"). It might predict the outcome of an experiment in a laboratory setting or the observation of a phenomenon in nature. The prediction can also be statistical and deal only with probabilities.

It is essential that the outcome of testing such a prediction be currently unknown. Only in this case does a successful outcome increase the probability that the hypothesis is true. If the outcome is already known, it is called a consequence and should have already been considered while [formulating the hypothesis](#Hypothesis_development).

If the predictions are not accessible by observation or experience, the hypothesis is not yet testable and so will remain to that extent unscientific in a strict sense. A new technology or theory might make the necessary experiments feasible. For example, while a hypothesis on the existence of other intelligent species may be convincing with scientifically based speculation, no known experiment can test this hypothesis. Therefore, science itself can have little to say about the possibility. In the future, a new technique may allow for an experimental test and the speculation would then become part of accepted science.

#### DNA-predictions

![](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_method//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/93/DNA_icon_%2825x25%29.png)

[James D. Watson](/wiki/James_D._Watson "James D. Watson"), [Francis Crick](/wiki/Francis_Crick "Francis Crick"), and others hypothesized that DNA had a helical structure. This implied that DNA's X-ray diffraction pattern would be 'x shaped'.[[63]](#cite_note-Crick_pp._137–138-86)[[62]](#cite_note-McElheny_2004_43-85) This prediction followed from the work of Cochran, Crick and Vand[[64]](#cite_note-HelixTransform-87) (and independently by Stokes). The Cochran-Crick-Vand-Stokes theorem provided a mathematical explanation for the empirical observation that diffraction from helical structures produces x shaped patterns.

In their first paper, Watson and Crick also noted that the [double helix](/wiki/Double_helix "Double helix") structure they proposed provided a simple mechanism for [DNA replication](/wiki/DNA_replication "DNA replication"), writing, "It has not escaped our notice that the specific pairing we have postulated immediately suggests a possible copying mechanism for the genetic material".[[95]](#cite_note-122) [_..4. DNA-experiments_](#DNA-experiments)

#### Another example: general relativity

[![](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_method//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/0/02/Gravitational_lens-full.jpg/220px-Gravitational_lens-full.jpg)](/wiki/File:Gravitational_lens-full.jpg)

[Einstein's prediction (1907): Light bends in a gravitational field](/wiki/Gravitational_lensing "Gravitational lensing")

Einstein's theory of [general relativity](/wiki/General_relativity "General relativity") makes several specific predictions about the observable structure of [spacetime](/wiki/Spacetime "Spacetime"), such as that [light](/wiki/Light "Light") bends in a [gravitational field](/wiki/Gravitational_field "Gravitational field"), and that the amount of bending depends in a precise way on the strength of that gravitational field. [Arthur Eddington](/wiki/Arthur_Eddington "Arthur Eddington")'s [observations made during a 1919 solar eclipse](/wiki/Eddington_experiment "Eddington experiment") supported General Relativity rather than Newtonian [gravitation](/wiki/Gravitation "Gravitation").[[96]](#cite_note-123)

### Experiments

Main article: [Experiment](/wiki/Experiment "Experiment")

Once predictions are made, they can be sought by experiments. If the test results contradict the predictions, the hypotheses which entailed them are called into question and become less tenable. Sometimes the experiments are conducted incorrectly or are not very well designed when compared to a [crucial experiment](/wiki/Crucial_experiment "Crucial experiment"). If the experimental results confirm the predictions, then the hypotheses are considered more likely to be correct, but might still be wrong and continue to be subject to [further testing.](#Evaluation_and_improvement) The [experimental control](/wiki/Experimental_control "Experimental control") is a technique for dealing with observational error. This technique uses [the contrast between multiple samples, or observations, or populations, under differing conditions](#the_control_group), to see what varies or what remains the same. We vary the conditions for the acts of measurement, to help isolate what has changed. [Mill's canons](/wiki/Mill%27s_canons "Mill's canons") can then help us figure out what the important factor is.[[97]](#cite_note-124) [Factor analysis](/wiki/Factor_analysis "Factor analysis") is one technique for discovering the important factor in an effect.

Depending on the predictions, the experiments can have different shapes. It could be a classical experiment in a laboratory setting, a [double-blind](/wiki/Double-blind "Double-blind") study or an archaeological [excavation](/wiki/Excavation_(archaeology) "Excavation (archaeology)"). Even taking a plane from [New York](/wiki/New_York_City "New York City") to [Paris](/wiki/Paris "Paris") is an experiment that tests the [aerodynamical](/wiki/Aerodynamics "Aerodynamics") hypotheses used for constructing the plane.

Scientists assume an attitude of openness and accountability on the part of those experimenting. Detailed record-keeping is essential, to aid in recording and reporting on the experimental results, and supports the effectiveness and integrity of the procedure. They will also assist in reproducing the experimental results, likely by others. Traces of this approach can be seen in the work of [Hipparchus](/wiki/Hipparchus "Hipparchus") (190–120 BCE), when determining a value for the precession of the Earth, while [controlled experiments](/wiki/Scientific_control "Scientific control") can be seen in the works of [al-Battani](/wiki/Muhammad_ibn_J%C4%81bir_al-Harr%C4%81n%C4%AB_al-Batt%C4%81n%C4%AB "Muhammad ibn Jābir al-Harrānī al-Battānī") (853–929 CE)[[98]](#cite_note-125) and [Alhazen](#alhazen) (965–1039 CE).[[6]](#cite_note-smith2001-9)[[v]](#cite_note-126)[[w]](#cite_note-127)[[g]](#cite_note-straightLinesOnly-49)

#### DNA-experiments

![](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_method//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/93/DNA_icon_%2825x25%29.png)

Watson and Crick showed an initial (and incorrect) proposal for the structure of DNA to a team from [King's College London](/wiki/King%27s_College_London "King's College London") – [Rosalind Franklin](/wiki/Rosalind_Franklin "Rosalind Franklin"), [Maurice Wilkins](/wiki/Maurice_Wilkins "Maurice Wilkins"), and [Raymond Gosling](/wiki/Raymond_Gosling "Raymond Gosling"). Franklin immediately spotted the flaws which concerned the water content. Later Watson saw Franklin's detailed [X-ray diffraction images](/wiki/Photo_51 "Photo 51") which showed an X-shape[[100]](#cite_note-129) and was able to confirm the structure was helical.[[24]](#cite_note-TeaTime-28)[[65]](#cite_note-Watson_1968_167-88) This rekindled Watson and Crick's model building and led to the correct structure. [_..1. DNA-characterizations_](#DNA-characterizations)

### Evaluation and improvement

The scientific method is iterative. At any stage, it is possible to refine its [accuracy and precision](/wiki/Accuracy_and_precision "Accuracy and precision"), so that some consideration will lead the scientist to repeat an earlier part of the process. Failure to develop an interesting hypothesis may lead a scientist to re-define the subject under consideration. Failure of a hypothesis to produce interesting and testable predictions may lead to reconsideration of the hypothesis or of the definition of the subject. Failure of an experiment to produce interesting results may lead a scientist to reconsider the experimental method, the hypothesis, or the definition of the subject.

By 1027, [Alhazen](/wiki/Alhazen "Alhazen"), based on his measurements of the [refraction](/wiki/Refraction "Refraction") of light, was able to deduce that [outer space](/wiki/Outer_space "Outer space") was less dense than [air](/wiki/Air "Air"), that is: "the body of the heavens is rarer than the body of air".[[36]](#cite_note-alhacenOnRefraction4.28-45) In 1079 [Ibn Mu'adh](/wiki/Ibn_Mu%27adh_al-Jayyani "Ibn Mu'adh al-Jayyani")'s _Treatise On Twilight_ was able to infer that Earth's atmosphere was 50 miles thick, based on [atmospheric refraction](/wiki/Atmospheric_refraction "Atmospheric refraction") of the sun's rays.[[x]](#cite_note-crepusculis-131)

Other scientists may start their own research and [enter the process](#Other_components) at any stage. They might adopt the characterization and formulate their own hypothesis, or they might adopt the hypothesis and deduce their own predictions. Often the experiment is not done by the person who made the prediction, and the characterization is based on experiments done by someone else. Published results of experiments can also serve as a hypothesis predicting their own reproducibility.

#### DNA-iterations

![](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_method//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/93/DNA_icon_%2825x25%29.png)

After considerable fruitless experimentation, being discouraged by their superior from continuing, and numerous false starts,[[102]](#cite_note-132)[[103]](#cite_note-133)[[104]](#cite_note-134) Watson and Crick were able to infer the essential structure of [DNA](/wiki/DNA "DNA") by concrete [modeling](/wiki/Model_(abstract) "Model (abstract)") [of the physical shapes](/wiki/DNA#History "DNA") of the [nucleotides](/wiki/Nucleotide "Nucleotide") which comprise it.[[25]](#cite_note-SameShape-29)[[105]](#cite_note-135)[[106]](#cite_note-136) They were guided by the bond lengths which had been deduced by [Linus Pauling](/wiki/Linus_Pauling "Linus Pauling") and by [Rosalind Franklin](/wiki/Rosalind_Franklin "Rosalind Franklin")'s X-ray diffraction images. [.._DNA Example_](#DNA_example)

### Confirmation

Science is a social enterprise, and scientific work tends to be accepted by the scientific community when it has been confirmed. Crucially, experimental and theoretical results must be reproduced by others within the scientific community. Researchers have given their lives for this vision; [Georg Wilhelm Richmann](/wiki/Georg_Wilhelm_Richmann "Georg Wilhelm Richmann") was killed by [ball lightning](/wiki/Ball_lightning "Ball lightning") (1753) when attempting to replicate the 1752 kite-flying experiment of [Benjamin Franklin](/wiki/Benjamin_Franklin "Benjamin Franklin").[[107]](#cite_note-137)

To protect against bad science and fraudulent data, government research-granting agencies such as the [National Science Foundation](/wiki/National_Science_Foundation "National Science Foundation"), and science journals, including _Nature_ and _Science_, have a policy that researchers must archive their data and methods so that other researchers can test the data and methods and build on the research that has gone before. [Scientific data archiving](/wiki/Scientific_data_archiving "Scientific data archiving") can be done at several national archives in the U.S. or the [World Data Center](/wiki/World_Data_Center "World Data Center").

## Scientific inquiry

Scientific inquiry generally aims to obtain [knowledge](/wiki/Knowledge "Knowledge") in the form of [testable explanations](#suitableTest)[[23]](#cite_note-SuitableTest-26)[[22]](#cite_note-econ-25) that scientists can use to [predict](/wiki/Predictability "Predictability") the results of future experiments. This allows scientists to gain a better understanding of the topic under study, and later to use that understanding to intervene in its causal mechanisms (such as to cure disease). The better an explanation is at making predictions, the more useful it frequently can be, and the more likely it will continue to explain a body of evidence better than its alternatives. The most successful explanations – those which explain and make accurate predictions in a wide range of circumstances – are often called [scientific theories](/wiki/Scientific_theories "Scientific theories").[[A]](#cite_note-aQuestion-7)

Most experimental results do not produce large changes in human understanding; improvements in theoretical scientific understanding typically result from a gradual process of development over time, sometimes across different domains of science.[[108]](#cite_note-138) Scientific models vary in the extent to which they have been experimentally tested and for how long, and in their acceptance in the scientific community. In general, explanations become accepted over time as evidence accumulates on a given topic, and the explanation in question proves more powerful than its alternatives at explaining the evidence. Often subsequent researchers re-formulate the explanations over time, or combined explanations to produce new explanations.

Tow sees the scientific method in terms of an [evolutionary algorithm](/wiki/Evolutionary_algorithm "Evolutionary algorithm") applied to science and technology.[[20]](#cite_note-tow-23) _See [Ceteris paribus](/wiki/Ceteris_paribus "Ceteris paribus")_, and _[Mutatis mutandis](/wiki/Mutatis_mutandis "Mutatis mutandis")_

### Properties of scientific inquiry

Scientific knowledge is closely tied to [empirical findings](/wiki/Empirical_evidence "Empirical evidence") and can remain subject to [falsification](/wiki/Falsifiability "Falsifiability") if new experimental observations are incompatible with what is found. That is, no theory can ever be considered final since new problematic evidence might be discovered. If such evidence is found, a new theory may be proposed, or (more commonly) it is found that modifications to the previous theory are sufficient to explain the new evidence. The strength of a theory relates to how long it has persisted without major alteration to its core principles (_see [invariant explanations](#Invariant_explanation)_).

Theories can also become subsumed by other theories. For example, Newton's laws explained thousands of years of scientific observations of the planets [almost perfectly](#Another_example:_precession_of_Mercury). However, these laws were then determined to be special cases of a more general theory ([relativity](/wiki/Theory_of_relativity "Theory of relativity")), which explained both the (previously unexplained) exceptions to Newton's laws and predicted and explained other observations such as the deflection of [light](/wiki/Light "Light") by [gravity](/wiki/Gravity "Gravity"). Thus, in certain cases independent, unconnected, scientific observations can be connected, unified by principles of increasing explanatory power.[[109]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEBrody199344–45-139)[[110]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEGoldhaberNieto2010942-140)

Since new theories might be more comprehensive than what preceded them, and thus be able to explain more than previous ones, successor theories might be able to meet a higher standard by explaining a larger body of observations than their predecessors.[[109]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEBrody199344–45-139) For example, the theory of [evolution](/wiki/Evolution "Evolution") explains the [diversity of life on Earth](/wiki/Biodiversity "Biodiversity"), how species adapt to their environments, and many other [patterns](/wiki/Pattern "Pattern") observed in the natural world;[[111]](#cite_note-Hall08-141)[[112]](#cite_note-Cracraft05-142) its most recent major modification was unification with [genetics](/wiki/Genetics "Genetics") to form the [modern evolutionary synthesis](/wiki/Extended_evolutionary_synthesis "Extended evolutionary synthesis"). In subsequent modifications, it has also subsumed aspects of many other fields such as [biochemistry](/wiki/Biochemistry "Biochemistry") and [molecular biology](/wiki/Molecular_biology "Molecular biology").[[20]](#cite_note-tow-23)

### Beliefs and biases

[![](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_method//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f3/Jean_Louis_Th%C3%A9odore_G%C3%A9ricault_001.jpg/220px-Jean_Louis_Th%C3%A9odore_G%C3%A9ricault_001.jpg)](/wiki/File:Jean_Louis_Th%C3%A9odore_G%C3%A9ricault_001.jpg)

Flying gallop as shown by this painting ([Théodore Géricault](/wiki/Th%C3%A9odore_G%C3%A9ricault "Théodore Géricault"), 1821) is [falsified](/wiki/Falsifiability "Falsifiability"); see below.

[![](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scientific_method//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d2/The_Horse_in_Motion_high_res.jpg/220px-The_Horse_in_Motion_high_res.jpg)](/wiki/File:The_Horse_in_Motion_high_res.jpg)

[Muybridge's photographs](/wiki/Sallie_Gardner_at_a_Gallop "Sallie Gardner at a Gallop") of _The Horse in Motion_, 1878, were used to answer the question of whether all four feet of a galloping horse are ever off the ground at the same time. This demonstrates a use of photography as an experimental tool in science.

Scientific methodology often directs that [hypotheses](/wiki/Hypothesis "Hypothesis") be tested in [controlled](/wiki/Scientific_control "Scientific control") conditions wherever possible. This is frequently possible in certain areas, such as in the biological sciences, and more difficult in other areas, such as in astronomy.

The practice of experimental control and reproducibility can have the effect of diminishing the potentially harmful effects of circumstance, and to a degree, personal bias. For example, pre-existing beliefs can alter the interpretation of results, as in [confirmation bias](/wiki/Confirmation_bias "Confirmation bias"); this is a [heuristic](/wiki/Heuristic "Heuristic") that leads a person with a particular belief to see things as reinforcing their belief, even if another observer might disagree (in other words, people tend to observe what they expect to observe).[[28]](#cite_note-beliefCreatesReality-35)

> [T]he action of thought is excited by the irritation of doubt, and ceases when belief is attained.
> 
> — [C.S. Peirce](/wiki/C.S._Peirce "C.S. Peirce"), _How to Make Our Ideas Clear_ (1877)[[34]](#cite_note-How-42)

A historical example is the belief that the legs of a [galloping](/wiki/Horse_gallop "Horse gallop") horse are splayed at the point when none of the horse's legs touch the ground, to the point of this image being included in paintings by its supporters. However, the first stop-action pictures of a horse's gallop by [Eadweard Muybridge](/wiki/Eadweard_Muybridge "Eadweard Muybridge") showed this to be false, and that the legs are instead gathered together.[[113]](#cite_note-143)

Another important human bias that plays a role is a preference for new, surprising statements (see _[Appeal to novelty](/wiki/Appeal_to_novelty "Appeal to novelty")_), which can result in a search for evidence that the new is true.[[114]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEGoldhaberNieto2010940-144) Poorly attested beliefs can be believed and acted upon via a less rigorous heuristic.[[115]](#cite_note-mythIsAbelief-145)

Goldhaber and Nieto published in 2010 the observation that if theoretical structures with "many closely neighboring subjects are described by connecting theoretical concepts, then the theoretical structure acquires a robustness which makes it increasingly hard – though certainly never impossible – to overturn".[[110]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEGoldhaberNieto2010942-140) When a narrative is constructed its elements become easier to believe.[[116]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTELakatos19761–19-146)[[29]](#cite_note-narrativeFallacy-36)

[Fleck 1979](#CITEREFFleck1979), p. 27 notes "Words and ideas are originally phonetic and mental equivalences of the experiences coinciding with them. ... Such proto-ideas are at first always too broad and insufficiently specialized. ... Once a structurally complete and closed system of opinions consisting of many details and relations has been formed, it offers enduring resistance to anything that contradicts it". Sometimes, these relations have their elements assumed _[a priori](/wiki/A_priori_and_a_posteriori "A priori and a posteriori")_, or contain some other logical or methodological flaw in the process that ultimately produced them. [Donald M. MacKay](/wiki/Donald_M._MacKay "Donald M. MacKay") has analyzed these elements in terms of limits to the accuracy of measurement and has related them to instrumental elements in a category of measurement.[[y]](#cite_note-macKay-147)

## Models of scientific inquiry

Main article: [Models of scientific inquiry](/wiki/Models_of_scientific_inquiry "Models of scientific inquiry")

### Classical model

The classical model of scientific inquiry derives from Aristotle,[[117]](#cite_note-148) who distinguished the forms of approximate and exact reasoning, set out the threefold scheme of [abductive](/wiki/Abductive_reasoning "Abductive reasoning"), [deductive](/wiki/Deductive_reasoning "Deductive reasoning"), and [inductive](/wiki/Inductive_reasoning "Inductive reasoning") [inference](/wiki/Inference "Inference"), and also treated the compound forms such as reasoning by [analogy](/wiki/Analogy "Analogy").

### Hypothetico-deductive model

The [hypothetico-deductive model](/wiki/Hypothetico-deductive_model "Hypothetico-deductive model") or method is a proposed description of the scientific method. Here, predictions from the hypothesis are central: if you assume the hypothesis to be true, what consequences follow?

If a subsequent empirical investigation does not demonstrate that these consequences or predictions correspond to the observable world, the hypothesis can be concluded to be false.

### Pragmatic model

In 1877,[[48]](#cite_note-Fixation-65) [Charles Sanders Peirce](/wiki/Charles_Sanders_Peirce "Charles Sanders Peirce") (1839–1914) characterized inquiry in general not as the pursuit of truth _per se_ but as the struggle to move from irritating, inhibitory doubts born of surprises, disagreements, and the like, and to reach a [secure belief](#Beliefs_and_biases), the belief being that on which one is prepared to act. He framed scientific inquiry as part of a broader spectrum and as spurred, like inquiry generally, by actual doubt, not mere verbal or [hyperbolic doubt](/wiki/Hyperbolic_doubt "Hyperbolic doubt"), which he held to be fruitless.[[z]](#cite_note-151) He outlined four methods of settling opinion, ordered from least to most successful:

1. The method of tenacity (policy of sticking to initial belief) – which brings comforts and decisiveness but leads to trying to ignore contrary information and others' views as if truth were intrinsically private, not public. It goes against the social impulse and easily falters since one may well notice when another's opinion is as good as one's own initial opinion. Its successes can shine but tend to be transitory.[[aa]](#cite_note-152)
2. The method of authority – which overcomes disagreements but sometimes brutally. Its successes can be majestic and long-lived, but it cannot operate thoroughly enough to suppress doubts indefinitely, especially when people learn of other societies' present and past.
3. The method of the _a priori_ – which promotes conformity less brutally but fosters opinions as something like tastes, arising in conversation and comparisons of perspectives in terms of "what is agreeable to reason." Thereby it depends on fashion in [paradigms](/wiki/Paradigm "Paradigm") and goes in circles over time. It is more intellectual and respectable but, like the first two methods, sustains accidental and capricious beliefs, destining some minds to doubt it.
4. The scientific method – the method wherein inquiry regards itself as [fallible](/wiki/Fallibilism "Fallibilism") and purposely tests itself and criticizes, corrects, and improves itself.

Peirce held that slow, stumbling [ratiocination](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/ratiocination "wikt:ratiocination") can be dangerously inferior to instinct and traditional sentiment in practical matters, and that the scientific method is best suited to theoretical research,[[120]](#cite_note-153) which in turn should not be trammeled by the other methods and practical ends; reason's "first rule" is that, in order to learn, one must desire to learn and, as a corollary, must not block the way of inquiry.[[21]](#cite_note-reasonsFirstRule-24) The scientific method excels the others by being deliberately designed to arrive – eventually – at the most secure beliefs, upon which the most successful practices can be based. Starting from the idea that people seek not truth _per se_ but instead to subdue irritating, inhibitory doubt, Peirce showed how, through the struggle, some can come to submit to the truth for the sake of belief's integrity, seek as truth the guidance of potential practice correctly to its given goal, and wed themselves to the scientific method.[[48]](#cite_note-Fixation-65)[[51]](#cite_note-Vital-68)

For Peirce, rational inquiry implies presuppositions about truth and the real; to reason is to presuppose (and at least to hope), as a principle of the reasoner's self-regulation, that the real is discoverable and independent of our vagaries of opinion. In that vein, he defined truth as the correspondence of a sign (in particular, a proposition) to its object and, pragmatically, not as the actual consensus of some definite, finite community (such that to inquire would be to poll the experts), but instead as that final opinion which all investigators _would_ reach sooner or later but still inevitably, if they were to push investigation far enough, even when they start from different points.[[34]](#cite_note-How-42) In tandem he defined the real as a true sign's object (be that object a possibility or quality, or an actuality or brute fact, or a necessity or norm or law), which is what it is independently of any finite community's opinion and, pragmatically, depends only on the final opinion destined in a sufficient investigation. That is a destination as far, or near, as the truth itself to you or me or the given finite community. Thus, his theory of inquiry boils down to "Do the science." Those conceptions of truth and the real involve the idea of a community both without definite limits (and thus potentially self-correcting as far as needed) and capable of definite increase of knowledge.[[121]](#cite_note-154) As inference, "logic is rooted in the social principle" since it depends on a standpoint that is, in a sense, unlimited.[[122]](#cite_note-155)

Paying special attention to the generation of explanations, Peirce outlined the scientific method as coordination of three kinds of inference in a purposeful cycle aimed at settling doubts, as follows (in §III–IV in "A Neglected Argument"[[4]](#cite_note-NA-5) except as otherwise noted):

1. _[Abduction](/wiki/Abductive_reasoning "Abductive reasoning")_ (or _retroduction_). Guessing, inference to explanatory hypotheses for selection of those best worth trying. From abduction, Peirce distinguishes induction as inferring, based on tests, the proportion of truth in the hypothesis. Every inquiry, whether into ideas, brute facts, or norms and laws, arises from surprising observations in one or more of those realms (and for example at any stage of an inquiry already underway). All explanatory content of theories comes from abduction, which guesses a new or outside idea to account in a simple, economical way for a surprising or complicative phenomenon. Oftenest, even a well-prepared mind guesses wrong. But the modicum of success of our guesses far exceeds that of sheer luck and seems born of attunement to nature by instincts developed or inherent, especially insofar as best guesses are optimally plausible and simple in the sense, said Peirce, of the "facile and natural", as by [Galileo](/wiki/Galileo "Galileo")'s natural light of reason and as distinct from "logical simplicity". Abduction is the most fertile but least secure mode of inference. Its general rationale is inductive: it succeeds often enough and, without it, there is no hope of sufficiently expediting inquiry (often multi-generational) toward new truths.[[123]](#cite_note-PAP-156) Coordinative method leads from abducing a plausible hypothesis to judging it for its [testability](/wiki/Testability "Testability")[[23]](#cite_note-SuitableTest-26) and for how its trial would economize inquiry itself.[[22]](#cite_note-econ-25) Peirce calls [his pragmatism](/wiki/Pragmaticism "Pragmaticism") "the logic of abduction".[[124]](#cite_note-157) His [pragmatic maxim](/wiki/Pragmatic_maxim "Pragmatic maxim") is: "Consider what effects that might conceivably have practical bearings you conceive the objects of your conception to have. Then, your conception of those effects is the whole of your conception of the object".[[34]](#cite_note-How-42) His pragmatism is a method of reducing conceptual confusions fruitfully by equating the meaning of any conception with the conceivable practical implications of its object's conceived effects – a method of experimentational mental reflection hospitable to forming hypotheses and conducive to testing them. It favors efficiency. The hypothesis, being insecure, needs to have practical implications leading at least to mental tests and, in science, lending themselves to scientific tests. A simple but unlikely guess, if uncostly to test for falsity, may belong first in line for testing. [A guess is intrinsically worth testing](/wiki/Twenty_Questions#divideAndConquer "Twenty Questions") if it has instinctive plausibility or reasoned objective probability, while [subjective likelihood](/wiki/Subjective_probability "Subjective probability"), though reasoned, can be misleadingly seductive. Guesses can be chosen for trial strategically, for their caution (for which Peirce gave as an example the game of [Twenty Questions](/wiki/Twenty_Questions#Computers,_scientific_method_and_situation_puzzles "Twenty Questions")), breadth, and incomplexity.[[125]](#cite_note-20Qs-158) One can hope to discover only that which time would reveal through a learner's sufficient experience anyway, so the point is to expedite it; the economy of research is what demands the leap, so to speak, of abduction and governs its art.[[22]](#cite_note-econ-25)
2. _[Deduction](/wiki/Deductive_reasoning "Deductive reasoning")_. Two stages:
    1. Explication. Unclearly premised, but deductive, analysis of the hypothesis in order to render its parts as clear as possible.
    2. Demonstration: Deductive argumentation, [Euclidean](/wiki/Euclid "Euclid") in procedure. Explicit deduction of hypothesis's consequences as predictions, for induction to test, about evidence to be found. [Corollarial](/wiki/Corollary "Corollary") or, if needed, theorematic.
3. _[Induction](/wiki/Inductive_reasoning "Inductive reasoning")_. The long-run validity of the rule of induction is deducible from the principle (presuppositional to reasoning, in general,[[34]](#cite_note-How-42)) that the real is only the object of the final opinion to which adequate investigation would lead;[[126]](#cite_note-159) anything to which no such process would ever lead would not be real. Induction involving ongoing tests or observations follows a method which, sufficiently persisted in, will diminish its error below any predesignate degree. Three stages:
    1. Classification. Unclearly premised, but inductive, classing of objects of experience under general ideas.
    2. Probation: direct inductive argumentation. Crude (the enumeration of instances) or gradual (new estimate of the proportion of truth in the hypothesis after each test). Gradual induction is qualitative or quantitative; if qualitative, then dependent on [weightings](/wiki/Weighting "Weighting") of qualities or characters;[[127]](#cite_note-160) if quantitative, then dependent on measurements, [or on statistics](/wiki/Charles_Sanders_Peirce#Probability_and_statistics "Charles Sanders Peirce"), or on countings.
    3. Sentential Induction. "... which, by inductive reasonings, appraises the different probations singly, then their combinations, then makes self-appraisal of these very appraisals themselves, and passes final judgment on the whole result".

### Invariant explanation

Model of [DNA](#DNA_example) with [David Deutsch](/wiki/David_Deutsch "David Deutsch"), proponent of [invariant scientific explanations](#Invariant_explanation) (2009)

This section is [transcluded](/wiki/Help:Transclusion "Help:Transclusion") from [David Deutsch](/wiki/David_Deutsch "David Deutsch"). ([edit](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=David_Deutsch&action=edit) | [history](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=David_Deutsch&action=history))

In a 2009 [TED talk](/wiki/TED_talk "TED talk"), Deutsch expounded a criterion for scientific explanation, which is to formulate invariants: "State an explanation [publicly, so that it can be dated and verified by others later] that remains invariant [in the face of apparent change, new information, or unexpected conditions]".[[128]](#cite_note-TED-161)

"A bad explanation is easy to vary."[[128]](#cite_note-TED-161): minute 11:22 

"The search for hard-to-vary explanations is the origin of all progress"[[128]](#cite_note-TED-161): minute 15:05 

"That _the truth consists of hard-to-vary assertions about reality_ is the most important fact about the physical world."[[128]](#cite_note-TED-161): minute 16:15 

Invariance as a fundamental aspect of a scientific account of reality had long been part of philosophy of science: for example, Friedel Weinert's book _The Scientist as Philosopher_ (2004) noted the presence of the theme in many writings from around 1900 onward, such as works by [Henri Poincaré](/wiki/Henri_Poincar%C3%A9 "Henri Poincaré") (1902), [Ernst Cassirer](/wiki/Ernst_Cassirer "Ernst Cassirer") (1920), [Max Born](/wiki/Max_Born "Max Born") (1949 and 1953), [Paul Dirac](/wiki/Paul_Dirac "Paul Dirac") (1958), [Olivier Costa de Beauregard](/wiki/Olivier_Costa_de_Beauregard "Olivier Costa de Beauregard") (1966), [Eugene Wigner](/wiki/Eugene_Wigner "Eugene Wigner") (1967), [Lawrence Sklar](/wiki/Lawrence_Sklar "Lawrence Sklar") (1974), [Michael Friedman](/wiki/Michael_Friedman_(philosopher) "Michael Friedman (philosopher)") (1983), [John D. Norton](/wiki/John_D._Norton "John D. Norton") (1992), [Nicholas Maxwell](/wiki/Nicholas_Maxwell "Nicholas Maxwell") (1993), [Alan Cook](/wiki/Alan_Cook "Alan Cook") (1994), [Alistair Cameron Crombie](/wiki/Alistair_Cameron_Crombie "Alistair Cameron Crombie") (1994), [Margaret Morrison](/wiki/Margaret_Morrison_(philosopher) "Margaret Morrison (philosopher)") (1995), [Richard Feynman](/wiki/Richard_Feynman "Richard Feynman") (1997), [Robert Nozick](/wiki/Robert_Nozick "Robert Nozick") (2001), and [Tim Maudlin](/wiki/Tim_Maudlin "Tim Maudlin") (2002).[[129]](#cite_note-162)

## Communication and community

See also: [Scientific community](/wiki/Scientific_community "Scientific community") and [Scholarly communication](/wiki/Scholarly_communication "Scholarly communication")

Frequently the scientific method is employed not only by a single person but also by several people cooperating directly or indirectly. Such cooperation can be regarded as an important element of a [scientific community](/wiki/Scientific_community "Scientific community"). Various standards of scientific methodology are used within such an environment.

### Peer review evaluation

Scientific journals use a process of _[peer review](/wiki/Peer_review "Peer review")_, in which scientists' manuscripts are submitted by editors of scientific journals to (usually one to three, and usually anonymous) fellow scientists familiar with the field for evaluation. In certain journals, the journal itself selects the referees; while in others (especially journals that are extremely specialized), the manuscript author might recommend referees. The referees may or may not recommend publication, or they might recommend publication with suggested modifications, or sometimes, publication in another journal. This standard is practiced to various degrees by different journals and can have the effect of keeping the literature free of obvious errors and generally improve the quality of the material, especially in the journals that use the standard most rigorously. The peer-review process can have limitations when considering research outside the conventional scientific paradigm: problems of "[groupthink](/wiki/Groupthink "Groupthink")" can interfere with open and fair deliberation of some new research.[[130]](#cite_note-163)

### Documentation and replication

Main article: [Reproducibility](/wiki/Reproducibility "Reproducibility")

Sometimes experimenters may make systematic errors during their experiments, veer from standard methods and practices ([Pathological science](/wiki/Pathological_science "Pathological science")) for various reasons, or, in rare cases, deliberately report false results. Occasionally because of this then, other scientists might attempt to repeat the experiments to duplicate the results.

#### Archiving

Researchers sometimes practice [scientific data archiving](/wiki/Scientific_data_archiving "Scientific data archiving"), such as in compliance with the policies of government funding agencies and scientific journals. In these cases, detailed records of their experimental procedures, raw data, statistical analyses, and source code can be preserved to provide evidence of the methodology and practice of the procedure and assist in any potential future attempts to [reproduce the result](/wiki/Reproducibility "Reproducibility"). These procedural records may also assist in the conception of new experiments to test the hypothesis, and may prove useful to engineers who might examine the potential practical applications of a discovery.

#### Data sharing

When additional information is needed before a study can be reproduced, the author of the study might be asked to provide it. They might provide it, or if the author refuses to [share data](/wiki/Data_sharing "Data sharing"), appeals can be made to the journal editors who published the study or to the institution which funded the research.

#### Limitations

Since a scientist cannot record _everything_ that took place in an experiment, facts selected for their apparent relevance are reported. This may lead, unavoidably, to problems later if some supposedly irrelevant feature is questioned. For example, [Heinrich Hertz](/wiki/Heinrich_Hertz "Heinrich Hertz") did not report the size of the room used to test Maxwell's equations, which later turned out to account for a small deviation in the results. The problem is that parts of the theory itself need to be assumed to select and report the experimental conditions. The observations are hence sometimes described as being 'theory-laden'.

## Science of complex systems

Science applied to complex systems can involve elements such as [transdisciplinarity](/wiki/Transdisciplinarity "Transdisciplinarity"), [systems theory](/wiki/Systems_theory "Systems theory"), [control theory](/wiki/Control_theory#Open-loop_and_closed-loop_(feedback)_control "Control theory"), and [scientific modelling](/wiki/Scientific_modelling "Scientific modelling"). The [Santa Fe Institute](/wiki/Santa_Fe_Institute "Santa Fe Institute") studies such systems;[[78]](#cite_note-Crutchfield-103) [Murray Gell-Mann](/wiki/Murray_Gell-Mann "Murray Gell-Mann") interconnects these topics with [message passing](/wiki/Message_passing "Message passing").[[131]](#cite_note-164)[[20]](#cite_note-tow-23)

Some biological systems, such those involved in [proprioception](/wiki/Proprioception "Proprioception"), have been fruitfully modeled by [engineering techniques](/wiki/Control_theory#Closed-loop_transfer_function "Control theory").[[132]](#cite_note-165)[[133]](#cite_note-166)

In general, the scientific method may be difficult to apply stringently to diverse, interconnected systems and large data sets. In particular, practices used within [Big data](/wiki/Big_data "Big data"), such as [predictive analytics](/wiki/Predictive_analytics "Predictive analytics"), may be considered to be at odds with the scientific method,[[134]](#cite_note-167) as some of the data may have been stripped of the parameters which might be material in alternative hypotheses for an explanation; thus the stripped data would only serve to support the null hypothesis in the predictive analytics application. [Fleck 1979](#CITEREFFleck1979), pp. 38–50 notes "a [scientific discovery remains incomplete without considerations of the social practices](#startWithBugs) that condition it".[[135]](#cite_note-bigDataCanBeIncomplete-168)

## Philosophy and sociology of science

See also: [Philosophy of science](/wiki/Philosophy_of_science "Philosophy of science") and [Sociology of scientific knowledge](/wiki/Sociology_of_scientific_knowledge "Sociology of scientific knowledge")

### Analytical philosophy

Philosophy of science looks at [the underpinning logic](#Pragmatic_model) of the scientific method, at what separates [science from non-science](/wiki/Demarcation_problem "Demarcation problem"), and the [ethic](/wiki/Research_ethics "Research ethics") that is implicit in science. There are basic assumptions, derived from philosophy by at least one prominent scientist,[[C]](#cite_note-introspection-43)[[136]](#cite_note-comprehensibility-169) that form the base of the scientific method – namely, that reality is objective and consistent, that humans have the capacity to perceive reality accurately, and that rational explanations exist for elements of the real world.[[136]](#cite_note-comprehensibility-169) These assumptions from [methodological naturalism](/wiki/Naturalism_(philosophy) "Naturalism (philosophy)") form a basis on which science may be grounded. [Logical positivist](/wiki/Logical_positivism "Logical positivism"), [empiricist](/wiki/Empiricism "Empiricism"), [falsificationist](/wiki/Falsifiability "Falsifiability"), and other theories have criticized these assumptions and given alternative accounts of the logic of science, but each has also itself been criticized.

[Thomas Kuhn](/wiki/Thomas_Kuhn "Thomas Kuhn") examined the history of science in his _[The Structure of Scientific Revolutions](/wiki/The_Structure_of_Scientific_Revolutions "The Structure of Scientific Revolutions")_, and found that the actual method used by scientists differed dramatically from the then-espoused method. His observations of science practice are essentially sociological and do not speak to how science is or can be practiced in other times and other cultures.

[Norwood Russell Hanson](/wiki/Norwood_Russell_Hanson "Norwood Russell Hanson"), [Imre Lakatos](/wiki/Imre_Lakatos "Imre Lakatos") and [Thomas Kuhn](/wiki/Thomas_Kuhn "Thomas Kuhn") have done extensive work on the ["theory-laden" character](/wiki/Perception "Perception") of observation. Hanson (1958) first coined the term for the idea that all observation is dependent on [the conceptual framework of the observer](/wiki/Situated_cognition "Situated cognition"), using the concept of [gestalt](/wiki/Gestalt_psychology "Gestalt psychology") to show how preconceptions can affect both observation and description.[[137]](#cite_note-170) He opens Chapter 1 with a discussion of the [Golgi bodies](/wiki/Golgi_apparatus "Golgi apparatus") and their initial rejection as an artefact of staining technique, and a discussion of [Brahe](/wiki/Tycho_Brahe "Tycho Brahe") and [Kepler](/wiki/Johannes_Kepler "Johannes Kepler") observing the dawn and seeing a "different" sunrise despite the same physiological phenomenon.[[i]](#cite_note-Kepler1604-56)[[ab]](#cite_note-171) Kuhn[[138]](#cite_note-172) and Feyerabend[[139]](#cite_note-173) acknowledge the pioneering significance of Hanson's work.

Kuhn said[_[Propose striking this paragraph as inconsistent with the article.](/wiki/Talk:Scientific_method#Kuhn_1961_p.166_citation "Talk:Scientific method")_] the scientist generally has a [theory](#Hypothesis) in mind before designing and undertaking [experiments](#Experiments) to make empirical observations, and that the "route from theory to measurement can almost never be traveled backward". For Kuhn, this implies that how theory is tested is dictated by the [nature of the theory](#Predictions_from_the_hypothesis) itself, which led Kuhn to argue that "once it has been adopted by a profession ... no theory is recognized to be testable by any quantitative tests that it has not already passed" (revealing Kuhn's rationalist thinking style).[[140]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEKuhn1961166-174)

### Post-modernism and science wars

[Paul Feyerabend](/wiki/Paul_Feyerabend "Paul Feyerabend") similarly examined the history of science, and was led to deny that science is genuinely a methodological process. In his book _[Against Method](/wiki/Against_Method "Against Method")_ he argues that scientific progress is _not_ the result of applying [any particular method](#critiquesOfFeyerabend). In essence, he says that for any specific method or norm of science, one can find a historic episode where violating it has contributed to the progress of science. Thus, if believers in the scientific method wish to express a single universally valid rule, Feyerabend jokingly suggests, it should be '[anything goes](#theTermSci)'.[[141]](#cite_note-175) However, this is uneconomic.[[B]](#cite_note-FRL-1.136-27) Criticisms such as Feyerabend's led to the [strong programme](/wiki/Strong_programme "Strong programme"), a radical approach to the [sociology of science](/wiki/Sociology_of_science "Sociology of science").

The [postmodernist](/wiki/Postmodernism "Postmodernism") critiques of science have themselves been the subject of intense controversy. This ongoing debate, known as the [science wars](/wiki/Science_wars "Science wars"), is the result of conflicting values and assumptions between the postmodernist and [realist](/wiki/Scientific_realism "Scientific realism") camps. Whereas postmodernists assert that scientific knowledge is simply another discourse (this term has special meaning in this context) and not representative of any form of fundamental truth, [realists](/wiki/Scientific_realism "Scientific realism") in the scientific community maintain that scientific knowledge does reveal real and fundamental truths about reality. Many books have been written by scientists which take on this problem and challenge the assertions of the postmodernists while defending science as a legitimate method of deriving truth.[[142]](#cite_note-176)

### Anthropology and sociology

In [anthropology](/wiki/Anthropology "Anthropology") and [sociology](/wiki/Sociology "Sociology"), following the [field research](/wiki/Field_research "Field research") in an academic scientific laboratory by [Latour](/wiki/Bruno_Latour "Bruno Latour") and [Woolgar](/wiki/Steve_Woolgar "Steve Woolgar"), [Karin Knorr Cetina](/wiki/Karin_Knorr_Cetina "Karin Knorr Cetina") has conducted a comparative study of two scientific fields (namely [high energy physics](/wiki/Particle_physics "Particle physics") and [molecular biology](/wiki/Molecular_biology "Molecular biology")) to conclude that the epistemic practices and reasonings within both scientific communities are different enough to introduce the concept of "[epistemic cultures](/wiki/Epistemic_cultures "Epistemic cultures")", in contradiction with the idea that a so-called "scientific method" is unique and a unifying concept.[[143]](#cite_note-177) Comparing 'epistemic cultures' with Fleck 1935, [Thought collectives](/wiki/Thought_collective "Thought collective"), (_denkkollektiven_): _Entstehung und Entwicklung einer wissenschaftlichen Tatsache: Einfǖhrung in die Lehre vom Denkstil und Denkkollektiv_[[144]](#cite_note-178) [Fleck 1979](#CITEREFFleck1979), p. xxvii recognizes that [facts have lifetimes](#genesisOfScientificFact), flourishing only after incubation periods. His selected question for investigation (1934) was "[HOW, THEN, DID THIS EMPIRICAL FACT ORIGINATE](/wiki/Thought_collective#predicateIsNotStatement "Thought collective") AND IN WHAT DOES IT CONSIST?".[[145]](#cite_note-179) But by [Fleck 1979, p.27](#genesisOfScientificFact), the thought collectives within the respective fields will have to settle on common specialized terminology, publish their results and [further intercommunicate](#Communication_and_community) with their colleagues using the common terminology, in order to progress.[[146]](#cite_note-180)

_See: [Cognitive revolution](/wiki/Cognitive_revolution "Cognitive revolution"), [Psychology and neuroscience](/wiki/Perceptual_control_theory#The_methodology_of_modeling,_and_PCT_as_model "Perceptual control theory")_

## Relationship with mathematics

Science is the process of gathering, comparing, and evaluating proposed models against [observables](/wiki/Observable "Observable"). A model can be a simulation, mathematical or chemical formula, or set of proposed steps. Science is like mathematics in that researchers in both disciplines try to distinguish what is _known_ from what is _unknown_ at each stage of discovery. Models, in both science and mathematics, need to be internally consistent and also ought to be _[falsifiable](/wiki/Falsifiable "Falsifiable")_ (capable of disproof). In mathematics, a statement need not yet be proved; at such a stage, that statement would be called a [conjecture](/wiki/Conjecture "Conjecture"). But when a statement has attained mathematical proof, that statement gains a kind of immortality which is highly prized by mathematicians, and for which some mathematicians devote their lives.[[147]](#cite_note-181)

Mathematical work and scientific work can inspire each other.[[33]](#cite_note-ilSaggiatore-41) For example, the technical concept of [time](/wiki/Time "Time") arose in [science](/wiki/Science "Science"), and timelessness was a hallmark of a mathematical topic. But today, the [Poincaré conjecture](/wiki/Poincar%C3%A9_conjecture "Poincaré conjecture") has been proved using time as a mathematical concept in which objects can flow (see [Ricci flow](/wiki/Ricci_flow "Ricci flow")).

Nevertheless, the connection between mathematics and reality (and so science to the extent it describes reality) remains obscure. [Eugene Wigner](/wiki/Eugene_Wigner "Eugene Wigner")'s paper, _[The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Mathematics in the Natural Sciences](/wiki/The_Unreasonable_Effectiveness_of_Mathematics_in_the_Natural_Sciences "The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Mathematics in the Natural Sciences")_, is a very well-known account of the issue from a Nobel Prize-winning physicist. In fact, some observers (including some well-known mathematicians such as [Gregory Chaitin](/wiki/Gregory_Chaitin "Gregory Chaitin"), and others such as [Lakoff and Núñez](/wiki/Where_Mathematics_Comes_From "Where Mathematics Comes From")) have suggested that mathematics is the result of practitioner bias and human limitation (including cultural ones), somewhat like the post-modernist view of science.

[George Pólya](/wiki/George_P%C3%B3lya "George Pólya")'s work on [problem solving](/wiki/Problem_solving "Problem solving"),[[148]](#cite_note-findIt-182) the construction of mathematical [proofs](/wiki/Mathematical_proof "Mathematical proof"), and [heuristic](/wiki/Heuristic "Heuristic")[[149]](#cite_note-183)[[150]](#cite_note-184) show that the mathematical method and the scientific method differ in detail, while nevertheless resembling each other in using iterative or recursive steps.

In Pólya's view, _understanding_ involves restating unfamiliar definitions in your own words, resorting to geometrical figures, and questioning what we know and do not know already; _analysis_, which Pólya takes from [Pappus](/wiki/Pappus_of_Alexandria "Pappus of Alexandria"),[[151]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEPólya1957142-185) involves free and heuristic construction of plausible arguments, [working backward from the goal](/wiki/Working_backward_from_the_goal "Working backward from the goal"), and devising a plan for constructing the proof; _synthesis_ is the strict [Euclidean](/wiki/Euclid "Euclid") exposition of step-by-step details[[152]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEPólya1957144-186) of the proof; _review_ involves reconsidering and re-examining the result and the path taken to it.

Building on Pólya's work, [Imre Lakatos](/wiki/Imre_Lakatos "Imre Lakatos") argued that mathematicians actually use contradiction, criticism, and revision as principles for improving their work.[[153]](#cite_note-187)[[ac]](#cite_note-stillwell'sReviewOfGray'sBioOfPoincaré-188) In like manner to science, where truth is sought, but certainty is not found, in _[Proofs and Refutations](/wiki/Proofs_and_Refutations "Proofs and Refutations")_, what Lakatos tried to establish was that no theorem of [informal mathematics](/wiki/Informal_mathematics "Informal mathematics") is final or perfect. This means that we should not think that a theorem is ultimately true, only that no [counterexample](/wiki/Counterexample "Counterexample") has yet been found. Once a counterexample, i.e. an entity contradicting/not explained by the theorem is found, we adjust the theorem, possibly extending the domain of its validity. This is a continuous way our knowledge accumulates, through the logic and process of proofs and refutations. (However, if axioms are given for a branch of mathematics, this creates a logical system —Wittgenstein 1921 _Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus_ 5.13; Lakatos claimed that proofs from such a system were [tautological](/wiki/Tautology_(logic) "Tautology (logic)"), i.e. [internally logically true](/wiki/Logical_truth "Logical truth"), by [rewriting forms](/wiki/String_rewriting_system "String rewriting system"), as shown by Poincaré, who demonstrated the technique of transforming tautologically true forms (viz. the [Euler characteristic](/wiki/Euler_characteristic "Euler characteristic")) into or out of forms from [homology](/wiki/Homology_(mathematics) "Homology (mathematics)"),[[154]](#cite_note-eulerPoincaré-189) or more abstractly, from [homological algebra](/wiki/Homological_algebra "Homological algebra").[[155]](#cite_note-190))[[156]](#cite_note-191)[[ac]](#cite_note-stillwell'sReviewOfGray'sBioOfPoincaré-188)

Lakatos proposed an account of mathematical knowledge based on Polya's idea of [heuristics](/wiki/Heuristic "Heuristic"). In _Proofs and Refutations_, Lakatos gave several basic rules for finding proofs and counterexamples to conjectures. He thought that mathematical '[thought experiments](/wiki/Thought_experiment "Thought experiment")' are a valid way to discover mathematical conjectures and proofs.[[158]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTELakatos197655-193)

[Gauss](/wiki/Carl_Friedrich_Gauss "Carl Friedrich Gauss"), when asked how he came about his [theorems](/wiki/Theorem "Theorem"), once replied "durch planmässiges Tattonieren" (through [systematic palpable experimentation](/wiki/Constructivism_(mathematics) "Constructivism (mathematics)")).[[159]](#cite_note-FOOTNOTEMackay1991100-194)

### Relationship with statistics

When the scientific method employs statistics as a key part of its arsenal, there are mathematical and practical issues that can have a deleterious effect on the reliability of the output of scientific methods. This is described in a popular 2005 scientific paper "Why Most Published Research Findings Are False" by [John Ioannidis](/wiki/John_Ioannidis "John Ioannidis"), which is considered foundational to the field of [metascience](/wiki/Metascience "Metascience").[[160]](#cite_note-195) Much research in metascience seeks to identify poor use of statistics and improve its use.[[ad]](#cite_note-misuseOfpValues-196)[[m]](#cite_note-misuseTtests-76) _See [Preregistration (science)#Rationale](/wiki/Preregistration_(science)#Rationale "Preregistration (science)")_

The particular points raised are statistical ("The smaller the studies conducted in a scientific field, the less likely the research findings are to be true" and "The greater the flexibility in designs, definitions, outcomes, and analytical modes in a scientific field, the less likely the research findings are to be true.") and economical ("The greater the financial and other interests and prejudices in a scientific field, the less likely the research findings are to be true" and "The hotter a scientific field (with more scientific teams involved), the less likely the research findings are to be true.") Hence: "Most research findings are false for most research designs and for most fields" and "As shown, the majority of modern biomedical research is operating in areas with very low pre- and poststudy probability for true findings." However: "Nevertheless, most new discoveries will continue to stem from hypothesis-generating research with low or very low pre-study odds," which means that *new* discoveries will come from research that, when that research started, had low or very low odds (a low or very low chance) of succeeding. Hence, if the scientific method is used to expand the frontiers of knowledge, research into areas that are outside the mainstream will yield the newest discoveries. _See: [Expected value of sample information](/wiki/Expected_value_of_sample_information "Expected value of sample information"), [False positives and false negatives](/wiki/False_positives_and_false_negatives "False positives and false negatives"), [Test statistic](/wiki/Test_statistic "Test statistic"), and [Type I and type II errors](/wiki/Type_I_and_type_II_errors "Type I and type II errors")_

### Role of chance in discovery

Main article: [Role of chance in scientific discoveries](/wiki/Role_of_chance_in_scientific_discoveries "Role of chance in scientific discoveries")

Somewhere between 33% and 50% of all [scientific discoveries](/wiki/Scientific_discovery "Scientific discovery") are estimated to have been _stumbled upon_, rather than sought out. This may explain why scientists so often express that they were lucky.[[161]](#cite_note-DunbarLuck-197) [Louis Pasteur](/wiki/Louis_Pasteur "Louis Pasteur") is credited with the famous saying that "Luck favours the prepared mind", but some psychologists have begun to study what it means to be 'prepared for luck' in the scientific context. Research is showing that scientists are taught various heuristics that tend to harness chance and the unexpected.[[161]](#cite_note-DunbarLuck-197)[[162]](#cite_note-Oliver,_J.E._1991-198) This is what [Nassim Nicholas Taleb](/wiki/Nassim_Nicholas_Taleb "Nassim Nicholas Taleb") calls "Anti-fragility"; while some systems of investigation are fragile in the face of [human error](/wiki/Human_error "Human error"), human bias, and randomness, the scientific method is more than resistant or tough – it actually benefits from such randomness in many ways (it is anti-fragile). Taleb believes that the more anti-fragile the system, the more it will flourish in the real world.[[52]](#cite_note-Anti-fragility-69)

Psychologist Kevin Dunbar says the process of discovery often starts with researchers finding bugs in their experiments. These unexpected results lead researchers to try to fix what they _think_ is an error in their method. Eventually, the researcher decides the error is too persistent and systematic to be a coincidence. The highly controlled, cautious, and curious aspects of the scientific method are thus what make it well suited for identifying such persistent systematic errors. At this point, the researcher will begin to think of theoretical explanations for the error, often seeking the help of colleagues across different domains of expertise.[[161]](#cite_note-DunbarLuck-197)[[162]](#cite_note-Oliver,_J.E._1991-198)

9. ^ [Jump up to: _**a**_](#cite_ref-Kepler1604_56-0) [_**b**_](#cite_ref-Kepler1604_56-1) Kepler was driven to this experiment after observing the partial solar eclipse at Graz, July 10, 1600. He used Tycho Brahe's method of observation, which was to project the image of the Sun on a piece of paper through a pinhole aperture, instead of looking directly at the Sun. He disagreed with Brahe's conclusion that total eclipses of the Sun were impossible because there were historical accounts of total eclipses. Instead, he deduced that the size of the aperture controls the sharpness of the projected image (the larger the aperture, the more accurate the image – this fact is now fundamental for optical system design). [Voelkel 2001](#CITEREFVoelkel2001), p. 61, notes that Kepler's 1604 experiments produced the first correct account of vision and the eye, because he realized he could not accurately write about astronomical observation by ignoring the eye. [Smith 2004](#CITEREFSmith2004), p. 192 recounts how Kepler used Giambattista della Porta's water-filled glass spheres to model the eye, and using an aperture to represent the entrance pupil of the eye, showed that the entire scene at the entrance pupil focused on a single point of the rear of the glass sphere (representing the retina of the eye). This completed Kepler's investigation of the optical train, as it satisfied his application to astronomy.

Alhazen (or Al-Haytham; 965–1039 CE) was perhaps one of the greatest physicists of all times and a product of the Islamic Golden Age or Islamic Renaissance (7th–13th centuries). He made significant contributions to anatomy, astronomy, engineering, [mathematics](/wiki/Mathematics "Mathematics"), medicine, ophthalmology, philosophy, physics, psychology, and visual perception and is primarily attributed as the inventor of the scientific method, for which author Bradley Steffens (2006) describes him as the "first scientist".

On further examination, however, the scientific method bears a striking similarity to the larger process of evolution itself. [...] Of great significance is the evolutionary algorithm, which uses a simplified subset of the process of natural evolution applied to find the solution to problems that are too complex to solve by traditional analytic methods. In essence, it is a process of accelerated and rigorous trial and error building on previous knowledge to refine an existing hypothesis, or discarding it altogether to find a better model. [...] The evolutionary algorithm is a technique derived from the evolution of knowledge processing applied within the context of science and technology, itself an outcome of evolution. The scientific method continues to evolve through adaptive reward, trial and error, and application of the method to itself.

Tea time — Franklin confronts Watson and his paper – "Of course it [Pauling's pre-print] is wrong. DNA is not a helix." However, Watson then visits Wilkins' office, sees [photo 51](/wiki/Photo_51 "Photo 51"), and immediately recognizes the diffraction pattern of a helical structure. But additional questions remained, requiring additional iterations of their research. For example, the number of strands in the backbone of the helix (Crick suspected 2 strands, but cautioned Watson to examine that more critically), the location of the base pairs (inside the backbone or outside the backbone), etc. One key point was that they realized that the quickest way to reach a result was not to continue a mathematical analysis, but to build a physical model. Later that evening — Watson urges Wilkins to begin model-building immediately. But Wilkins agrees to do so only after Franklin's departure.

The art of physical measurement seemed to be a matter of compromise, of choosing between reciprocally related uncertainties. ... Multiplying together the conjugate pairs of uncertainty limits mentioned, however, I found that they formed invariant products of not one but two distinct kinds. ...

The second group could be calculated only _a posteriori_ from a specification of what was _done_ with the instrument. ...

This form allowed the bases' hydrogen bonds to pair 'unlike' with 'unlike', rather than to pair 'like' with 'like', as Watson was inclined to model, based on the textbook statements. On February 27, 1953, Watson was convinced enough to make cardboard models of the nucleotides in their keto form.

But after trying 'unlike with unlike', and getting [Jerry Donohue](/wiki/Jerry_Donohue "Jerry Donohue")'s approval, the base pairs turned out to be identical in shape (as Watson stated above in his 1968 _Double Helix_ memoir quoted above). Watson now felt confident enough to inform Crick.
