# 2022-12-03: An academic vault tour & weekly review templates
Media workflow diagrams, film project dashboards, daily journaling discussions, python libraries for batch-changing metadata, and more!

## In The Community

* Here's a curated list of [360+ bookmarks related to Obsidian](https://pkm.social/@oldtowneast/109431696194437578) maintained by `@oldtowneast` and shared over at the new [pkm.social](https://pkm.social/) mastodon instance.

## Obsidian Updates

It's been awhile since the last Obsidian update, and traditionally there are a bunch of people secretly worrying that this means the app is dead, no more updates are coming, the team has stopped production, etc. ðŸ˜… so I just wanted to put a little note here and remind everybody that before mobile and live preview went live, there was also a gap of a month or two between updates. 

If you're curious what's being worked on, you can check out [the roadmap](https://trello.com/b/Psqfqp7I/obsidian-roadmap) â€“ it looks like metadata improvements and a core canvas plugin are the next big things to expect.

## Plugin News

### New in Community Plugins

_These plugins went through code review and are now available in Obsidian's plugin list._ For the full list, check out the [plugin stats page](https://obsidian-plugin-stats.vercel.app/new).

* [Omnisearch](https://github.com/scambier/obsidian-omnisearch) by `@scambier` Â uses a smart weighting algorithm to show more relevant results.
* [Rapid Notes](https://github.com/valteriomon/obsidian-rapid-notes) by `@valteriomon` Â lets users create and place notes quickly in specific folders based on predefined prefixes.

### Pending (as of Friday morning)

_Note: Not all new plugins are available in the community list yet, as they need to go through code review first. You can manually install plugins that aren't in the community list yet by using the [Beta Reviewer's Auto-update Tool](https://github.com/TfTHacker/obsidian42-brat). Note, though, that this is not as safe as waiting for them to go through code review._

* [D2](https://github.com/terrastruct/d2-obsidian) by `@berniexie` adds functionality for a diagram scripting language that turns text to diagrams.
* [Crumbs](https://github.com/tgrosinger/crumbs-obsidian) by `@tgrosinger` is a new alternative to [Breadcrumbs](https://github.com/SkepticMystic/breadcrumbs) that seems more focused on Dendron-style dot hierarchies.
* [Copy Note URL](https://github.com/juliuszfedyk/obsidian-copy-note-url-plugin) by `@juliuszfedyk` Â lets users copy a note's URL based on a predefined domain and file extension.
* [evergreen](https://github.com/zk4/obsidian-evergreen) by `@zk4` Â is similar to the "no dupe leaves" plugin in that it will automatically switch the focus to open notes instead of reopening them, but works with stacked tabs.
* [Chord Lyrics](https://github.com/nevernotmove/obsidian-chordlyrics) by `@nevernotmove` Â will display chord names over lyrics. Supports line wrapping, section headers and auto-detection.
* [Surfing](https://github.com/Quorafind/Obsidian-Surfing) by `@Quorafind` Â makes it easier to browse the web within Obsidian.
* [Text Dataset Aid Plugin](https://github.com/conneroisu/Text-Dataset-Aid-Plugin) by `@conneroisu` Â makes fine-tuning datasets for language models a lot easier, which allows for increased accuracy, better style, more control, increased flexibility, etc. in text prediction/generation.
* [Obsidian Stylist](https://github.com/ixth/obsidian-stylist) by `@ixth` Â makes it easier to add classes and styles on markdown blocks.

### Updates

_If you want a comprehensive list of what plugins updated this week, check out this [plugin updates index](https://obsidian-plugin-stats.vercel.app/updates) by Ganessh Kumar._

* [Tasks](https://obsidian-tasks-group.github.io/obsidian-tasks/queries/explaining-queries/) can now explain what your queries are doing.
* [CardBoard](https://obsidian.md/plugins?id=card-board) now honors the RTL editor settings and got some tag-related improvements.
* [Commander](https://github.com/phibr0/obsidian-commander) has startup macros for running commands on startup, color-coding, and other bug fixes.
* [RPG Manager](https://github.com/carlonicora/obsidian-rpg-manager/releases/tag/3.4.0) v3.4 changed how elements are identified, allows Scenes / Acts / Sessions / Adventures to be reorganised by a simple drag-and-drop. It also saves all the relationships at the bottom of the note, which helps with the graph view.
* [Database Folder](https://github.com/RafaelGB/obsidian-db-folder/releases/tag/3.0.0) 3.0.0 got a design refresh, configurable shortcuts, improved display options, and mobile pagination.

## Ancillary Code

## Guides

* Here's a new [beginner's guide to using Obsidian for role playing games](https://www.patreon.com/posts/75382566?pr=true).

* Here's a [weekly review template](https://miscellaneplans.gumroad.com/l/plusminusnext) with useful icons, modelled on the [Plus Minus Next](https://nesslabs.com/plus-minus-next) method and set up for a complete year. It's very detailed and looks lovely.

## Ancillary Tools

* [py-obsidianmd](https://github.com/selimrbd/py-obsidianmd) is a python library that enables you to batch change note metadata and move metadata between YAML and inline styles. There's a [video explanation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gRPBAKiu37Y) along with [examples](https://selimrbd.github.io/py-obsidianmd/examples/).

## Housekeeping

My birthday is this weekend. Look at the pretty new desktop tower holder my husband installed for me to celebrate:
