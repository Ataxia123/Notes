Here's a basic ASCII map template that you can use as a starting point:

```
##########
#........#
#........#
#........#
#........#
#........#
##########
```

In this template, each `#` represents a wall or an obstacle, and each `.` represents an open space or a room. You can customize and expand this template to fit your game world. Add more symbols or ASCII art to represent different elements like doors, stairs, or special features.

For example, you can modify the template to include a room with a door:

```
##########
#........#
#..D.....#
#........#
#........#
#........#
##########
```

In this modified template, `D` represents a door. You can use different symbols or characters to represent various elements based on your preference and the complexity of your map.

Feel free to enhance the template further by adding more details or annotations using ASCII art or markdown formatting.
