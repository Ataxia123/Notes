I would recommend making copies of this and the [[Race Dice Tables]], and tweaking it for each location that has different racial make ups. ( That is, if you care about minor details like this;; )

Also, with so many tables it can slow obsidian down on a reroll, therefore I would consider removing sections you aren't interested in!
