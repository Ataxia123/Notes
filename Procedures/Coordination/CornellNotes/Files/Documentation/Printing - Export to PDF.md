# Printing and PDF
>[!cue] Export to PDF Command

Obsidian has no **Print** feature. However, we can export a Markdown document to PDF using the **Export to PDF** command. This command will generate a PDF document that can then be printed. 

The Export to PDF command though has its limitations. It is very likely that the formatting and layout of your Markdown document will look slightly different in print. 

This can be frustrating, but it is important to remember that the way a Markdown document renders on a screen will be different from paper since both mediums have advantages and disadvantages. Obsidian makes some choices about how Markdown is rendered into PDF, which in most cases does the job very well, but in some cases may not be what you expected.

>[!cue] Limitations

The cornell.css includes some additional parameters to help with exporting Markdown documents to PDF. However, there are some limitations. Keep the following in mind:
- Only cues are displayed in the margin.
- Summaries are not rendered at the top or bottom of a page, rather they render as a standard Obsidian callout. 
- If you enabled border lines in your document, these are not exported to PDF. (This is due to the difference in how Obsidian handles PDF documents)

While there are limitations, the overall effect of Cornell Notes is maintained when exporting a Markdown document to PDF.
