# Frequently Asked Questions

### Are Cornell Notes for paper note-taking only?
No! While originally developed as a note-taking methodology for classroom note-taking on paper, the principles and concepts can be applied to digital note-taking. This vault shows you how to do that.

In fact, I even use the Cue and Summary concepts on a whiteboard when brainstorming with my team. I think the concepts of Cornell Notes can be applied to many mediums.

### Are Cornell Notes compatible with atomic notes or evergreen notes?
Yes and no. The concepts of each of these note-taking methods are not in conflict with one another. However, don't feel that you need to use the Cornell Note method for every note. Cornell Notes tend to be better suited for long-form notes, or notes where cue callouts are advantageous. We encourage you to experiment with each of these styles and don't be afraid to mix and match them in your vault. The complement each other more than they oppose each other. 

### Are cues and summaries supported when exporting to PDF from within ?
No. It seems CSS snippets are not supported in the export process.
